<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>"Dave Porter in the South Seas" is a complete
story in itself, but forms the second volume in
a line issued under the general title of "Dave Porter
Series."</p>

<p>In the first volume of this series, called "Dave
Porter at Oak Hall," I introduced a typical American
boy, and gave something of his haps and mishaps
at an American boarding school of to-day.
At this school Dave made a number of warm
friends, and also a few enemies, and was the
means of bringing one weak and misguided youth
to a realization of his better self. Dave was poor
and had to fight his way to the front, and this was
not accomplished until he had shown those around
him what a truly straightforward and manly fellow
he was.</p>

<p>The one great cloud over Dave's life was the
question of his parentage. He had been raised by
those who knew practically nothing of his past,
and when he thought that he saw a chance to learn
something about himself, he embraced that opportunity
eagerly, even though it necessitated a long
trip to the South Seas and a search among strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
islands and still stranger natives. Dave makes the
trip in a vessel belonging to the father of one of
his school chums, and is accompanied by several
of his friends. Not a few perils are encountered,
and what the boys do under such circumstances I
leave for the pages that follow to tell.</p>

<p>In penning this tale, I have had a twofold object
in view: first, to give my young readers a view of
a long ocean trip and let them learn something of
the numerous islands which dot the South Seas, and,
in the second place, to aid in teaching that old
truth&mdash;that what is worth having is worth working
for.</p>

<p>Again I thank the many thousands of boys and
girls, and older persons, too, who have shown their
appreciation of my efforts to amuse and instruct
them. I can only add, as I have done before, that
I sincerely trust that this volume fulfills their every
reasonable expectation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE BOYS OF OAK HALL</h3>


<p>"Hello, Dave; where are you bound?"</p>

<p>"For the river, Phil. I am going out for a row.
Want to come along?"</p>

<p>"That suits me," answered Phil Lawrence,
throwing down the astronomy he had been studying.
"But I can't stay out late," he added, reaching
for his cap. "Got two examples in algebra to
do. Have you finished up?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Dave Porter. "They are not
so hard."</p>

<p>"And your Latin?"</p>

<p>"That's done, too."</p>

<p>Phil Lawrence eyed the boy before him admiringly.
"Dave, I don't see how you manage it.
You're always on deck for fun, and yet you scarcely
miss a lesson. Let me into the secret, won't you?"</p>

<p>"That's right, Dave; pull the cover off clean and
clear," came from a youth who had just entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the school dormitory. "If I can get lessons without
studying&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Roger, you know better than that," burst
out Dave Porter, with a smile. "Of course I have
to study&mdash;just the same as anybody. But when I
study, I study, and when I play, I play. I've found
out that it doesn't pay to mix the two up&mdash;it is best
to buckle your mind down to the thing on hand and
to nothing else."</p>

<p>"That's the talk," came from a boy resting on
one of the beds. "It puts me in mind of a story I
once heard about a fellow who fell from the roof
of a house to the ground&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There goes Shadow again!" cried Roger Morr.
"Shadow, will you ever get done telling chestnuts?"</p>

<p>"This isn't a chestnut, and I haven't told it
over twice in my life. The man fell to the ground
past an open window. As he was going down, he
grabbed another man at the window by the hair.
The hair&mdash;it was a wig&mdash;came off. 'Say,' yells
the man at the window. 'Leave me alone. If you
want to fall, 'tend to business, and fall!'" And a
smile passed around among the assembled schoolboys.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Roger would like to come along," continued
Dave. "I was going out for a row, and Phil
said he would go, too," he explained.</p>

<p>"That suits me," answered Roger Morr. "It
will give us an appetite for supper."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>"What about you, Shadow?" and Dave turned
to the youth on the bed.</p>

<p>Maurice Hamilton shook his head slightly.
"Not to-day. I am going to take a nap, if I can
get it. Remember, I was up half the night."</p>

<p>"So he was," affirmed Phil Lawrence. "But he
hasn't said what it was about."</p>

<p>"Not much," growled the boy called Shadow.
He was very tall and very thin, hence the nickname.
Turning over, he pretended to go to sleep.</p>

<p>"There is something wrong about Shadow," said
Dave as he and his two companions left the school
building and hurried for the river at the back of
the grounds. "He has not been himself at all to-day."</p>

<p>"I think he has had something to do with that
bully, Gus Plum," said Phil. "I saw them together
two days ago, and both were talking earnestly. I
don't know exactly what it was about. But I know
Shadow has been very much disturbed ever since."</p>

<p>"Well, the best he can do is to leave Plum
alone," returned Dave, decidedly. "I can tell you,
fellows, that chap is not to be trusted; you know
that as well as I do."</p>

<p>"Of course we know it," said Roger Morr.
"Didn't I warn you against Gus Plum before you
ever came to Oak Hall? And now that Chip
Macklin has turned over a new leaf and refused
to be Plum's toady any longer, the bully is worse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
than ever. Only yesterday Buster Beggs caught
him back of the gym., abusing one of the little
fellows. Buster is generally too lazy to rouse up,
but he said it made him mad, and he told Plum to
stop, or it would be the worse for him, and Plum
went off grumbling."</p>

<p>"It's a great pity Plum can't reform, like
Macklin. I declare, Chip is getting to be quite a
decent sort, now."</p>

<p>"It's not in Plum to reform," exclaimed Phil
Lawrence. "If I were Doctor Clay, I'd get rid of
him. Why, such a chap can keep a whole school in
hot water."</p>

<p>"Somebody said that Plum's father had lost
a good bit of his money," observed Roger Morr.
"If that is so, it must be a bitter pill for Gus to
swallow."</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't taunt him with it, if it's true,"
replied Dave, quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I shan't say a word&mdash;although he deserves
to have it rubbed in, for the way he treated you,
Dave."</p>

<p>"Yes, that was a jolly shame," commented Phil.
"It makes me angry every time I think of it."</p>

<p>"I am willing to let bygones be bygones," said
Dave, with a little smile. "As it was, it only
showed me who my true friends were, and are. I
can afford to get along without the others."</p>

<p>"And especially after we waxed Plum and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
crowd at baseball, and then won our great victory
over the Rockville boys," said Roger. "Oh, but
wasn't that a dandy victory! And didn't we have
a dandy celebration afterwards!"</p>

<p>"And do you remember the big cannon cracker
we set off in the courtyard?" Dave's eyes began
to twinkle. "I heard afterwards that Pop Swingly,
the janitor, was scared almost to death. He
thought somebody was trying to blow up the
building."</p>

<p>"Yes, and Job Haskers said if he could catch the
fellow who&mdash;&mdash;" Phil broke off short. "Here
comes Gus Plum, now," he whispered.</p>

<p>The others looked up, and saw coming toward
them across the school grounds a tall, broad-shouldered
individual, loudly dressed, and with a shock
of uncombed hair and a cap set over on one ear.</p>

<p>"Hello, Plum," said Dave, pleasantly, while his
two companions nodded to the newcomer.</p>

<p>"Hello, yourself," came shortly from Gus Plum.
"Hold up a minute," he went on, planting himself
in front of the three.</p>

<p>"What's wanted?" questioned Phil, in a little
surprise.</p>

<p>"I want to know if Shadow Hamilton has been
saying anything about me to you," growled the
bully of Oak Hall.</p>

<p>"I haven't heard anything," answered Phil,
while Dave and Roger shook their heads.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"Humph! He had better not!" muttered Plum,
with a scowl. "If he does&mdash;&mdash;" The bully did
not finish.</p>

<p>"I hope there is no more trouble in the air," was
Dave's comment.</p>

<p>"There will be trouble, if Hamilton opens his
trap. I won't allow anybody in this school to talk
about me, and all of you had better understand it,"
and the bully glared at the others defiantly.</p>

<p>"I am sure I don't know what you are talking
about," said Dave. "I haven't said anything about
you."</p>

<p>"And you haven't heard anything?" inquired
Gus Plum, with a look of keen anxiety showing on
his coarse face.</p>

<p>"I've heard some roundabout story about your
father losing money," said Roger, before Dave
could answer. "If it is true, I am sorry for you,
Gus."</p>

<p>"Bah! I don't want your sympathy. Did
Hamilton tell you that story?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are spreading it right and left,
eh? Making me out to be a pauper, like your
friend Porter, eh?" continued Gus Plum, working
himself up into a magnificent condition of ill-humor.</p>

<p>"I am not spreading it right and left," answered
Roger, quietly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I am not a pauper, Plum!" exclaimed
Dave, with flashing eyes. "I thought we had
settled that difference of opinion long ago. If you
are going to open it up again&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't mind what he says, Dave," broke in
Phil, catching his chum by the arm. "You know
nobody in the school pays attention to him."</p>

<p>"I won't let any of you run me down!" roared
Gus Plum. "Now, just you remember that! If
any of you say a word about me or my father, I'll
make it so hot for you that you'll wish you had
never been born. My father has lost a little money,
but it ain't a flea-bite to what he is worth, and I
want everybody in this school to know it."</p>

<p>"And I want you to know that you cannot continue
to insult me," blazed out Dave. "I am not as
rich as most of the boys here, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He is just as good as any of us, Plum, remember
that," finished Phil. "It is an outrage for you
to refer to Dave as a pauper."</p>

<p>"Well, didn't he come from the poorhouse, and
ain't he a nobody?" sneered the bully.</p>

<p>"He is a better fellow than you will ever be,
Plum," said Roger, warmly. He and Phil were
both holding Dave back. "Don't listen to him,
Dave."</p>

<p>"Yes, but, fellows&mdash;&mdash;" Dave's face was white,
and he trembled all over.</p>

<p>"I know it cuts you," whispered Roger. "But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Plum is a&mdash;a brute. Don't waste your breath on
him."</p>

<p>"Ho! so I am a brute, am I?" blustered the big
bully, clenching his fists.</p>

<p>"Yes, you are," answered Roger, boldly. "Any
fellow with a spark of goodness and honor in him
would not speak to Dave as you have done. It
simply shows up your own low-mindedness, Plum."</p>

<p>"Don't you preach!" shouted the bully. "Say
another word, and I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We are not afraid of you," said Phil, firmly.
"We've told you that before. We intend to leave
you alone, and the best thing you can do is to leave
us alone."</p>

<p>"Bah! I know you, and you can't fool me!
You say one thing to my face and another behind
my back. But don't you dare to say too much; and
you can tell Shadow Hamilton not to say too much,
either. If you do&mdash;well, there will be war, that's
all&mdash;and all of you will get what you don't want!"
And with this threat, Gus Plum hurried around a
corner of the school building and out of sight.</p>

<p>"What a cad!" murmured Phil.</p>

<p>"He is worked up; no disputing that," was
Roger's comment. "He acts as if he was afraid
something was being told that he wished to keep
a secret."</p>

<p>The hot blood had rushed to Dave's face, and
he was still trembling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish I had knocked him down," he said in a
low tone.</p>

<p>"What good would it have done?" returned
Roger. "It would only get you into trouble with
the doctor, and that is just what Plum would like.
When it comes to a standing in the class, he knows
he hasn't as much to lose as you have. He is
almost at the bottom already, while you are close
to the top."</p>

<p>"But, Roger, he said&mdash;oh, I can't bear to think
about it! I suppose he blabs it to everybody, too,
and they will think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't give it another thought, Dave," said Phil,
soothingly, and he turned his chum toward the river
again. "Dismiss Plum and all his meanness from
your mind."</p>

<p>"I wish I could," answered Dave, and his voice
had a great deal of seriousness in it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>A GLIMPSE OF THE PAST</h3>


<p>As the three boys hurried to the river, Dave
Porter felt that all his anticipated sport for that
afternoon had been spoiled. He had been brought
face to face once more with the one dark spot in
his history, and his heart was filled with a bitterness
which his two loyal chums could scarcely
comprehend.</p>

<p>Dave was indeed a poorhouse boy, and of unknown
parentage. When but a few years of age,
he had been found one evening in the summer wandering
close to the railroad tracks just outside of
the village of Crumville. How he was found by
some farm hands and taken to a house and fed and
cared for otherwise, has already been related in the
first volume of this series, entitled "Dave Porter at
Oak Hall."</p>

<p>At first, every effort to learn his identity was
made, but, this failing, he was turned over to the
poorhouse authorities. He said his name was
Dave, or Davy, and sometimes added Porter, and
then Dun-Dun, and from this he was called Dave
Porter&mdash;a name which suited him very well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Dave remained at the poorhouse until he was
about nine years old, when he was taken out of
that institution by a broken-down college professor
named Caspar Potts, who had turned farmer. He
remained with the old professor for several years,
and a warm friendship sprang up between the pair.
Caspar Potts gave Dave a fair education, and, in
return, the boy did all he could for the old man,
who was not in the best of health, and rather eccentric
at times.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Professor Potts, there was in
the neighborhood a hard-hearted money-lender
named Aaron Poole, who had a mortgage on the
old educator's farm. The money-lender had a son
named Nat, who was a flippant youth, and this boy
had trouble with Dave. Then the money-lender
would have sold out the old professor, had not
aid come opportunely from a most unexpected
quarter.</p>

<p>In this volume it is unnecessary to go into the
details of how Dave became acquainted with Mr.
Oliver Wadsworth, a rich manufacturer of the
neighborhood, and how the boy saved Jessie Wadsworth
from being burned to death when the gasoline
tank of an automobile exploded and enveloped
the young miss in flames. For this service the
Wadsworths were all more than grateful, and when
Dave told his story Oliver Wadsworth made the
discovery that Caspar Potts was one of the pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>fessors
under whom he had studied in his college
days.</p>

<p>"I must meet him and talk this over," said the
rich manufacturer, and the upshot of the matter
was that the professor and Dave were invited to
dine at the Wadsworth mansion.</p>

<p>This dinner proved a turning point in the life
of the poorhouse youth. Mr. Wadsworth had lost
a son by death, and Dave reminded him strongly
of his boy. It was arranged that Caspar Potts
should come to live at the Wadsworth mansion,
and that Dave should be sent to some first-class
boarding school, the manufacturer agreeing to pay
all bills, because of the boy's bravery in behalf of
Jessie.</p>

<p>Oak Hall was the school selected, a fine institution,
located not far from the village of Oakdale.
The school was surrounded by oaks, which partly
shaded a beautiful campus, and the grounds, which
were on a slight hill, sloped down in the rear to the
Leming River.</p>

<p>Dave's heart beat high when he started off for
Oak Hall, and he had a curious experience before
he reached that institution. The house of a Senator
Morr was robbed, and the boy met the robber on
the train, and, after a good deal of trouble, managed
to recover a valise containing a large share of
the stolen goods. This threw Dave into the company
of Roger Morr, the senator's son, and the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
became warm friends. Roger was on his way to
Oak Hall, and it was through him that Dave became
acquainted with Phil Lawrence&mdash;reckoned by
many the leader of the academy; Maurice Hamilton,
generally called Shadow; Sam Day, Joseph
Beggs,&mdash;who always went by the name of Buster,
because he was so fat,&mdash;and a number of others. In
Crumville Dave had had one boy friend, Ben Basswood,
and Ben also came to Oak Hall, and so did
Nat Poole, as flippant and loud-mouthed as ever.</p>

<p>But Dave soon found out that Nat Poole was not
half so hard to get along with as was Gus Plum,
the big bully of the Hall. There was a difference
of opinion almost from the start, and Plum did all
he could to annoy Dave and his friends. Plum
wanted to be a leader in baseball and in athletics
generally, and when he found himself outclassed,
he was savagely bitter.</p>

<p>"I'll get square!" he told his toady, Chip
Macklin, more than once; but his plans to injure
Dave and his chums fell through, and, in the end,
Macklin became disgusted with the bully and left
him. Most of the boys wanted nothing to do with
the boy who had been the bully's toady, but Dave
put in a good word for him, and, in the end,
Macklin was voted a pretty fair fellow, after all.</p>

<p>With the toady gone, Gus Plum and Nat Poole
became very thick, and Poole lost no opportunity
of telling how Dave had been raised at the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>house.
Gus Plum took the matter up, and for a
while poor Dave was made miserable by those who
turned their backs on him. But Doctor Clay, who
presided over the academy, sided with Dave, and
so did all of the better class of students, and soon
the affair blew over, at least for the time being.
But now the bully was agitating it again, as we
have just seen.</p>

<p>During the winter term at Oak Hall one thing
of importance had occurred, of which some particulars
must be given, for it has much to do with
our present tale. Some of the boys, including
Dave, had skated up the river to what was locally
called the old castle&mdash;a deserted stone dwelling
standing in a wilderness of trees. They had arrived
at this structure just in time to view a quarrel between
two men&mdash;one a sleek-looking fellow and
the other an elderly man, dressed in the garb of a
sailor. The sleek-looking individual was the man
who had robbed Senator Morr's house, and just as
he knocked the old sailor senseless to the ground,
the boys rushed in and made him a prisoner.</p>

<p>When the old sailor came to his senses, he stared
at Dave as if the boy were a ghost. He said his
name was Billy Dill and that he had sailed the
South Seas and many other portions of the briny
deep. He insisted that he knew Dave well, and
wanted to know why the youth had shaved off his
mustache. The boys imagined that the tar was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
out of his head, and he was removed to a hospital.
Later on, as Dave was so interested in the man,
Mr. Wadsworth had him taken to a private sanitarium.
Here he lingered for awhile between life
and death, but at last grew better physically, although
his mind was sadly unbalanced, and he
could recall the past only in a hazy way.</p>

<p>Yet he insisted upon it, over and over again,
that he had met Dave before, or, if not the youth,
then somebody who looked exactly like him, although
older. Pressed to tell his story, he said he
had met this man on Cavasa Island, in the South
Seas. He also mentioned a crazy nurse and a lost
child, but could give no details, going off immediately
into a wild flight about the roaring of the sea
in his ears and the dancing of the lighthouse beacon
in his eyes.</p>

<p>"He must know something of my past," Dave
said, when he came away from visiting the old tar.
"Oh, if only his mind were perfectly clear!"</p>

<p>"We must wait," answered Oliver Wadsworth,
who was along. "I think his mind will clear after
awhile. It is certainly clearer now than it was
some months ago."</p>

<p>"The man he knows may be my father, or some
close relative."</p>

<p>"That may be true, Dave. But don't raise any
false hopes. I should not like to see you disappointed
for the world."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Dave knew that Phil Lawrence's father was a
shipping merchant of considerable standing, owning
an interest in a great number of vessels. He
went to Phil and learned that the boy was going to
take a trip to the South Seas that very summer, and
was going to stop at Cavasa Island.</p>

<p>"I am going on business for my father," explained
Phil. "It is something special, of which he
wishes the supercargo to know nothing." And then
he told Dave all he knew of Cavasa Island and its
two towns and their inhabitants. After that, Dave
sent a letter to both of the towns, asking if there
were any persons there by the name of Porter, or if
any English-speaking person had lost a child years
ago, but so far no answer had been received.</p>

<p>Of course, Phil wanted to know why Dave was
so anxious to learn about his proposed trip, and,
in the end, the poorhouse boy told his story, to
which his chum listened with interest.</p>

<p>"Phil, what would you say if I wanted to go
with you on that trip to Cavasa Island?" Dave
had said, after his story was finished.</p>

<p>"Do you really mean it, Dave?" had been the
return question, and Phil's face had shown his
astonishment.</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;if matters turn out as I think they may."</p>

<p>"That is, if that old sailor gets around so that
he can tell a pretty straight story?"</p>

<p>"Yes."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I'd like your company, first-rate. But&mdash;"
Phil drew a deep breath&mdash;"I'd hate to see you
go on a wild-goose chase. Think of traveling thousands
of miles and then being disappointed at the
end of the trip. That old sailor may simply be
crazy."</p>

<p>"I don't think so. Why should he mention a
lost child&mdash;a boy?"</p>

<p>"Well, that is the only thing that makes it look
as if there was something in the story. But couldn't
I do the looking for you?"</p>

<p>"No, I'd prefer to do that myself. Besides, you
must remember, that sailor did not come directly
from Cavasa Island to this country. So, whoever
was on the island&mdash;I mean the person I may be interested
in&mdash;may have gone elsewhere&mdash;in which
case I should want to follow him."</p>

<p>"I see. Well, Dave, do what you think is best,
and may good luck go with you!" Phil had said;
and there the conversation on the subject had come
to a close.</p>

<p>It was not until a week later that Dave had
called on Billy Dill again&mdash;to find the old tar
sitting on a porch of the sanitarium, smoking his
pipe contentedly.</p>

<p>"On deck again, my hearty!" had been the greeting.
"Give us your flipper," and a warm handshake
had followed.</p>

<p>But the visit had been productive of little good.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Billy Dill could remember nothing clearly, excepting
that he knew a man who looked very much like
Dave, and that that man had been his friend while
he was stranded on Cavasa Island and looking for
a chance to ship. He said he could recall a bark
named the <i>Mary Sacord</i> and a crazy nurse called
Polly, but that was all.</p>

<p>"I had a picter o' that man once&mdash;the feller that
looks like you," he said. "But I dunno what's
become o' it," and then he had scratched his head
and gone off into a rambling mumble that meant
nothing at all. And Dave had gone back to Oak
Hall more mystified than ever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THREE CHUMS ON THE RIVER</h3>


<p>Down at the boathouse the three boys procured
a round-bottomed rowboat, and were soon on the
river. Roger took one pair of oars and motioned
to Phil to let Dave take the other.</p>

<p>"Let him do the most of the rowing&mdash;it will help
him to forget his troubles," he whispered, and
Phil understood.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful afternoon in the early summer,
with just the faintest breeze stirring the trees
which lined the river bank on either side. The
boys pulled a good stroke, and Roger purposely
kept Dave at it, until both were thoroughly
warmed up.</p>

<p>"You're improving in your stroke," remarked
Dave, as they came to a bend in the watercourse
and rested on their oars for a minute. "Perhaps
you are training for the boat races."</p>

<p>"Well, I shouldn't mind going into a race," returned
the senator's son. "It would be lots of
sport, even if I didn't win."</p>

<p>"I am going into some of the field contests this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
summer," said Phil. "That is, if they come off
before I go away."</p>

<p>"When do you expect to start?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet. It depends upon when one
of my father's vessels gets back to San Francisco
and ships her cargo."</p>

<p>"I've heard a rumor that the Hall is to be shut
up early this summer," said Dave. "The doctor is
thinking of building an addition before the fall
term begins, and he wants to give the masons and
carpenters as much of a show as possible."</p>

<p>"Do you remember that day we were on the
river, and Gus Plum ran into us with that gasoline
launch?" observed Phil. "My, what a mess we
were in!"</p>

<p>"I've had trouble with him ever since I clapped
eyes on him," answered Dave.</p>

<p>"Oh, let's talk about something else!" cried
Roger. "No matter where we start from, we always
end up with Gus Plum. And, by the way,
do you notice how thick he is with Nat Poole since
Macklin has refused to toady to him?"</p>

<p>"They are almost of a stripe, Roger," answered
Dave. "I know Nat Poole thoroughly. The only
difference is that Poole is more of a dandy when it
comes to dress."</p>

<p>"Poole says he is going in for athletics this summer,"
said Phil. "I overheard him telling Luke
Watson so."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is Luke going into training?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so. He loves his banjo and guitar
too much."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd love them, too, if I could play as he
does," returned Dave.</p>

<p>"Luke told me he had noticed something strange
about Shadow," put in Roger. "He asked me if I
knew what made Shadow so worried. He said he
hadn't heard a funny story out of him for a week,
and that's unusual, for Shadow is generally telling
about a dozen a day."</p>

<p>"It is possible that he may be fixing for a
regular spell of sickness," was Dave's comment.
"That's the way some things come on, you
know."</p>

<p>The boys resumed their rowing, and Roger put
on a burst of speed that made Dave work with a
will in order to keep up with him. Then, of a
sudden, there came a sharp click and the senator's
son tumbled over backwards, splashing the water
in every direction.</p>

<p>"Whoop! look out!" yelled Phil. "I don't want
any shower-bath! Did you catch a crab, Roger?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no, I didn't," spluttered the senator's son,
when he had regained a sitting position. "There's
the trouble," and he pointed to a broken oarlock.</p>

<p>"That's too bad," declared Dave. "Boys, we
shall have to have that fixed before we take the boat
back to the boathouse&mdash;or else we'll have to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Mr. Dale." The man he mentioned was the first
assistant instructor at the Hall.</p>

<p>"Let us row down to Ike Rasmer's boathouse
and see if he will sell us an oarlock," suggested
Roger. "He ought to have plenty on hand."</p>

<p>"All right," said Phil; "and, as both of you must
be tired now, I'll take my turn," and he motioned
to Dave to change seats with him, while Roger
drew in his remaining oar.</p>

<p>The man whom Roger had mentioned was a
boatman who rented out craft of various kinds.
His boathouse was about half a mile away, but
Phil covered the distance with ease. They found
Rasmer out on his little dock, painting a tiny sloop
a dark green.</p>

<p>"How do you do, boys?" he called out, pleasantly.
"Out for an airing?"</p>

<p>"No, we came down to see if you needed any
painters," answered Dave.</p>

<p>"Well, I dunno. What do you think of this job
of mine? Ain't it pretty slick?" And Ike Rasmer
surveyed his work with evident satisfaction.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Ike," answered Roger. "When
you give up boating, take to house-painting, by all
means."</p>

<p>"House-painting?" snorted the man. "Not fer
me! I ain't goin' to fall off no slippery ladder an'
break my neck. I'd rather paint signs. What's
that you've got, a broken oarlock?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, and I want to know if you'll sell me one
to match?"</p>

<p>"Sure I will," answered Ike Rasmer, with a
twinkle in his eye. He threw down his paint brush
and walked into his boathouse. "Here you be, my
boy!" And he held up the parts of a broken oarlock.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I&mdash;I didn't want a broken one," stammered
the senator's son.</p>

<p>"Didn't ye say you wanted one to match? Ho,
ho! I reckon I cotched you that trip, didn't I?"
And the man continued to laugh, and Dave and
Phil joined in.</p>

<p>"Ike must have swallowed a whetstone this
morning," observed Dave.</p>

<p>"A whetstone?" queried the old boatman.
"Why?"</p>

<p>"You're so awfully sharp."</p>

<p>"Ho, ho! That's one on me, sure enough."
The man slapped Dave on the shoulder. "You
Hall boys are the cute ones, ain't ye? Well, if you
want a good oarlock, you shall have it," and he
brought forth a number, that Roger might make
his selection. The senator's son did so, and paid
for it out of his pocket-money.</p>

<p>"We ought to pay for part of that," said Dave,
always ready to do what was fair.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't bother, Dave; it's only a trifle," answered
his chum.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Say, some of you boys are out pretty late
nights," observed Ike Rasmer, as he resumed his
painting, and while Roger was adjusting the new
oarlock to the gunwale of the Hall boat.</p>

<p>"Out late?" queried Phil.</p>

<p>"Yes, mighty late."</p>

<p>"I haven't been out for a month."</p>

<p>"Nor I," added Dave and Roger.</p>

<p>"I see that young Hamilton not long ago&mdash;the
fellow that tells stories whenever he can get the
chance. And I saw Gus Plum, too."</p>

<p>"Together?" asked Dave, with sudden interest.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. But they were out the same night."</p>

<p>"Late?"</p>

<p>"I should say so&mdash;after twelve o'clock."</p>

<p>"What were they doing, Ike?" asked Phil.</p>

<p>"Rowing along the river. Each had a small
boat&mdash;I guess one from the school. It was bright
moonlight, and I saw them quite plainly when they
passed Robbin's Point, where I was fishing."</p>

<p>"And each was alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Hamilton was right ahead of Plum, and
both rowing along at good speed, too. I thought
it was mighty strange, and made up my mind I'd
ask you boys about it. But, say, I don't want you
to get them into trouble," added the old boatman,
suddenly. "They are both customers of mine,
sometimes."</p>

<p>"I shan't say anything," answered Roger. "But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
this puzzles me," he continued, turning to his
friends.</p>

<p>"Each boy was alone in a boat?" queried Dave.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And Plum was following Hamilton?"</p>

<p>"He seemed to be. Anyway, his boat was behind
the other."</p>

<p>"Was anybody else around?" asked Phil.</p>

<p>"I didn't see a soul, and the river was almost
as bright as day."</p>

<p>"Did you see them a second time?" asked Dave.</p>

<p>"No, for I was getting ready to go home when
they came along. I don't know where they went,
or when they got back."</p>

<p>Ike Rasmer could tell no more than this, and as
it was getting late the three boys lost no time in
shoving off once more and pulling for the Hall
boathouse.</p>

<p>"This stumps me," declared the senator's son.
"What do you make of it? Do you think Shadow
and Plum are up to something between them?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," answered Dave, decidedly.
"Shadow is not the fellow to train with Gus Plum.
He doesn't like the bully any more than we do."</p>

<p>"No wonder Shadow feels sleepy, if he spends
his nights on the river," said Phil. "But I can't
make out what he is up to, I must confess. If it
was some fun, he would surely take somebody with
him."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys pulled with all their strength, yet when
they arrived at the Hall boathouse, they found that
they were exactly twelve minutes behind the supper
hour.</p>

<p>"No time to wash up," said Roger. "We'll be
lucky if we can slip into the dining room without
being observed."</p>

<p>With all speed they tied up their craft and ran
for the school building. They were just entering
the side door when they were brought face to face
with Job Haskers, the second assistant teacher and
a man who was very dictatorial in his manner.</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried Job Haskers, catching Dave by
the shoulder. "What do you mean by coming in
at this hour?"</p>

<p>"We were out on the river and broke an oarlock,
Mr. Haskers," replied Dave.</p>

<p>"Humph! an old excuse."</p>

<p>"It is the truth, sir," and Dave's face flushed.</p>

<p>"I broke the oarlock," said Roger. "We got
back as soon as we could&mdash;as soon as we got a new
lock at Ike Rasmer's boathouse."</p>

<p>"We cannot allow pupils to come in half an hour
late," went on Job Haskers, loftily. "Directly
after supper, report to me in classroom 7," and he
passed on.</p>

<p>"We are in for it now," grumbled Phil. "It's
a shame! It wasn't our fault that the oarlock
broke."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wonder what he will make us do?" came from
the senator's son.</p>

<p>"Something not very pleasant," answered Dave.
He had encountered the second assistant many
times before and knew the harsh instructor well.</p>

<p>They were soon in their seats at the table. Some
of the other students looked at them inquiringly,
but nothing was said. Not far from Dave sat Gus
Plum and Nat Poole, and both favored the poor
boy with a scowl, to which Dave paid no attention.</p>

<p>The meal finished, Dave, Phil, and the senator's
son brushed up a bit, and then hurried to classroom
7, located in an angle of the building. They were
soon joined by Job Haskers.</p>

<p>"The three of you may remain here and each
write the word 'Oarlock' two hundred times," said
the second assistant. "As soon as all of you have
finished, ring the bell, and I will come and inspect
the work. It must be neatly done, or I shall make
you do it over again." And then he left them to
themselves, going out and closing the door tightly
after him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>A PLOT TO "SQUARE UP"</h3>


<p>"Phew! but this is a real picnic!" came softly
from Phil. "He's as kind as they make 'em,
isn't he?"</p>

<p>"It's a jolly shame," grumbled the senator's son.
"To make us stay in this stuffy classroom on such
a fine evening as this."</p>

<p>"I am glad I finished with my lessons," was
Dave's comment. "But I am sorry for you two.
But, as there is no help for it, we might as well
get to work. The sooner begun, the sooner done,
you know." And he began to write away vigorously
on one of the pads the teacher had pointed
out to them.</p>

<p>"I wish old Haskers had to write it himself,"
growled Roger, as he, too, went at the task. "Oh,
but isn't he the mean one! I don't see why the
doctor keeps him."</p>

<p>"He's smart, that's why," answered Phil. "I
wish we could get square for this. I'm sure Doctor
Clay would have excused us, had he known the
facts. I've a good mind to go to him about it."</p>

<p>"Don't you do it, Phil," cried Dave. "It's not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
worth it. Get to work&mdash;and we'll think about
squaring up afterwards."</p>

<p>In a minute more all three of the boys were
writing as rapidly as their fingers could travel over
the paper. Roger was the best penman of the
three and finished several minutes before the others.
He began to walk up and down the room, whistling
softly to himself.</p>

<p>"Yes, I go in for squaring up with old Haskers,"
he said, rather loudly. "He's about as mean&mdash;&mdash;"
And then he stopped short, as the door swung open
and the second assistant appeared.</p>

<p>"Huh!" he snorted. "Were you alluding to
me, Master Morr?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Roger stammered, and his face turned red.</p>

<p>"Her&mdash;here are the words," he stammered.</p>

<p>"Two hundred, eh? Well, you may write a
hundred more, and after this be careful of what
you say." And then Job Haskers turned to Dave
and Phil. "That is all right, you two can go."</p>

<p>"Can I stay with Roger?" asked Dave.</p>

<p>"No, I shall remain here myself," was the cold
answer, and then Dave and Phil had to leave.</p>

<p>"I'll wager Roger feels like hugging him," was
Phil's comment. "He will want to get square now,
sure."</p>

<p>The two boys went out on the campus for awhile
and then up to their dormitory, where they found
a small crowd assembled, some talking, and a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
studying. The door to the adjoining dormitory
was open, and there Luke Watson was playing on
a banjo, while another student was singing a negro
song in a subdued voice.</p>

<p>"I say, Dave, will you explain something to
me?" said a voice from a corner. The question
came from Chip Macklin, Gus Plum's former
toady. The small boy was working over a sheet
of algebra sums.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Dave, readily, and sat down
by the other's side. "Now, what is it? Oh, I
see. I got twisted on that myself once. This is
the proper equation, and you can reduce it this
way," and he was soon deep in the problem, with
Chip looking on admiringly. When the problem
had been worked out and explained in detail, the
small boy was very grateful.</p>

<p>"And, Dave," he went on, in a low tone, "I&mdash;I
want to tell you something. Be on your guard
against Plum and Nat Poole."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because they are plotting mischief. I heard
them talking in the gym. I don't know what it is
about, but they are surely up to something."</p>

<p>"I'll remember, Chip, and much obliged," answered
Dave, and then he turned to the other
boys, leaving the small youth to finish his examples.</p>

<p>"Hello, where have you been?" came from stout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and lazy Buster Beggs. He was sprawled out on
the end of a couch. "I noticed you didn't get to
supper till late, and went right off, directly you had
finished."</p>

<p>"Had a special session with Haskers," answered
Dave. "He wants me to improve my handwriting."</p>

<p>There was a smile at this, for all the boys knew
what it meant.</p>

<p>"Oh, that fellow is a big peach, he is!" came
from Sam Day, who sat in one of the windows.
"Yesterday, he made me stay in just because I asked
Tolliver for a lead pencil."</p>

<p>"He was mad because Polly Vane caught him
in an error in grammar," added another youth.
"Didn't you, Polly?" he added, addressing a rather
girlish-looking boy who sat near Chip Macklin.</p>

<p>"I did," was the soft answer. "It was rather a
complicated sentence, but perfectly clear to me,"
explained the boy.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder, for Polly fairly lives on grammar
and language," put in Phil. "I don't believe
anybody could trip him up," and this compliment
made Bertram Vane blush like a girl. He was in
reality one of the best scholars in the academy.</p>

<p>"Which puts me in mind of a story," came from
one of the cots. "An&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hello, are you awake, Shadow?" cried Sam
Day. "I thought you were snoozing."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"So I was, but I am slept out, and feel better now.
As I was saying, an old farmer and a college professor
went out rowing together. Says the college
professor, 'Can you do sums in algebra?' 'No,'
answers the farmer. 'Then you have missed a
great opportunity,' says the professor. Just then
the boat struck a rock and went over. 'Save me!'
yells the professor. 'Can't you swim?' asked the
farmer. 'No.' 'Then you have lost the chance of
your life!' says the farmer, and strikes out and
leaves the professor to take care of himself."</p>

<p>"Two hundredth time!" came in a solemn voice
from the doorway to the next room.</p>

<p>"Wha&mdash;what do you mean? I never told any
story two hundred times," cried Shadow Hamilton.
"And that puts me in mind&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shadow, if you tell another as bad as that, I'll
heave you out of the window," came from Sam
Day. "That has moss on it three inches th&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know you, Lazy; you're jealous, that's
all. You couldn't tell a story if you stood on your
head."</p>

<p>"Can you, Shadow?" and then a general laugh
went up, in the midst of which the door opened,
and Job Haskers entered. On catching sight of
the unpopular teacher, Sam Day lost no time in
sliding from the window-sill to a chair.</p>

<p>"Boys, we cannot permit so much noise up
here!" cried Job Haskers. "And that constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
strumming on a banjo must be stopped. Master
Day, were you sitting in the window?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;I think I was," stammered Sam.</p>

<p>"You are aware that is against the rules. If you
fell out, the Hall management would be held responsible.
After school to-morrow you can write the
words, 'Window-sill,' two hundred times. Hamilton,
get up, and straighten out that cot properly.
I am ashamed of you." And then the hated teacher
passed on to the next dormitory.</p>

<p>"I told you to get out of the window," said
Macklin, as soon as they were alone. "I was
caught that way myself once, and so was Gus
Plum."</p>

<p>"Lazy is going to learn how to write a little better,
too," said Dave, with a grin.</p>

<p>At that moment Roger came in, looking thoroughly
disgusted.</p>

<p>"Made me write half of it over again," he explained.
"Oh, it's simply unbearable! Say, I am
going to do something to get square, as sure as
eggs is eggs."</p>

<p>"Eggs are eggs," corrected Polly Vane, sweetly.</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks, Polly. What about a tailor's
goose?"</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"If one tailor's goose is a goose, what are half
a dozen?"</p>

<p>"Tailor's geese, I suppose&mdash;but, no, you'd not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
say that. Let me see," and the girlish youth dove
into his books. "That's a serious question, truly!"
he murmured.</p>

<p>"Well, I am willing to get square, too," put in
Sam Day.</p>

<p>"So am I," grunted Shadow Hamilton. "There
was no need to call me down as he did, simply because
the cot was mussed up a bit. The question
is, what's to be done?"</p>

<p>The boys paused and looked at each other.
Then a sudden twinkle came into Dave's clear
eyes.</p>

<p>"If we could do it, it would be great," he murmured.</p>

<p>"Do what, Dave?" asked several at once.</p>

<p>"I don't care to say, unless I am certain we are
all going to stand together."</p>

<p>"We are!" came in a chorus from all but Polly
Vane, who was still deep in his books.</p>

<p>"What about you, Polly?" called out Roger.</p>

<p>"Me? Why&mdash;er&mdash;if a tailor's goose is a real
goose, not a flatiron goose&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, drop the goose business. We are talking
about getting square with Haskers. Will you
stand with the crowd?"</p>

<p>"You see, we don't want to make gooses of
ourselves," said Phil, with a wink at Polly Vane.</p>

<p>"I'll stand by you," said Polly. "But please
don't ask me to do something ridiculous, as when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
we dumped that feather bed down from the third-story
landing, and caught those visitors, instead of
Pop Swingly."</p>

<p>"I was only thinking of Farmer Cadmore's
ram," said Dave, innocently. "He is now tied up
in a field below here. I don't think he likes to be
out over night. He'd rather be under shelter&mdash;say
in Mr. Haskers' room."</p>

<p>"Whoop!" cried Roger. "Just the thing! We
will store him away in old Haskers' closet."</p>

<p>This plan met with instant approval, and the
boys drew straws as to which of them should endeavor
to execute the rather difficult undertaking.
Three were to go, and the choice fell upon Dave,
Phil, and Sam Day. The others promised to remain
on guard and issue a warning at the first intimation
of danger.</p>

<p>"I think the coast will be fairly clear," said Sam
Day. "I heard Haskers tell Doctor Clay he was
going out to-night and would not be back until
eleven, or after. That ought to give us plenty
of time in which to do the trick."</p>

<p>The three boys could not leave the dormitory
until the monitor, Jim Murphy, had made the
rounds and seen to it that all was right for the
night and the lights put out. Then they stole out
into the hallway and down a back stairs. Soon
they were out of the building and making for
Farmer Cadmore's place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>As they left the Hall they did not see that they
were being watched, yet such was a fact. Nat
Poole had been out on a special errand and had
seen them depart. At once that student hurried to
tell his friend, Gus Plum.</p>

<p>"Going out, eh?" said the big bully.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I heard them say something about
making it warm when they got back," returned
Nat Poole.</p>

<p>"Humph! Nat, we must put a spoke in their
wheel."</p>

<p>"I'm willing. What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"I'll think something up&mdash;before they get back,"
replied the bully of Oak Hall. "They haven't
any right to be out, and I guess we've got 'em just
where we want 'em."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>WHAT THE PLOT LED TO</h3>


<p>It was a clear night, with no moon, but with
countless stars bespangling the heavens. All was
quiet around Oak Hall, and the three boys found
it an easy matter to steal across the campus, gain
the shade of a row of oaks, and get out on the side
road leading to the Cadmore farm.</p>

<p>"We don't want to get nabbed at this," was
Phil's comment. "If Farmer Cadmore caught us,
he would make it mighty warm. He's as irritable
as old Farmer Brown, and you'll remember what
a time we had with him and his calf."</p>

<p>"Does he keep a dog?" asked Dave. "I haven't
any use for that sort of an animal, if he is
savage."</p>

<p>"No, he hasn't any dog," answered Phil. "I
was asking about it last week." But Phil was mistaken;
Jabez Cadmore did have a dog&mdash;one he had
purchased a few days before. He was a good-sized
mastiff, and far from gentle.</p>

<p>Walking rapidly, it did not take the three boys
long to reach the first of Farmer Cadmore's fields.
This was of corn, and passing through it and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
over a potato patch, they came to an orchard,
wherein they knew the ram was tied to one of the
trees.</p>

<p>"Now, be careful!" whispered Dave, as he
leaped the rail-fence of the orchard. "Somebody
may be stirring around the farmhouse"&mdash;pointing
to the structure some distance away.</p>

<p>"Oh, they must be in bed by this time," said
Phil. "Farmers usually retire early. Cadmore is
a close-fisted chap, and he won't want to burn up his
oil or his candles."</p>

<p>With hearts which beat rather rapidly, the boys
stole along from one tree to another. Then they
saw a form rise out of the orchard grass, and all
gave a jump. But it was only the ram, and the
animal was more frightened than themselves.</p>

<p>"Look out that he doesn't butt you," warned
Dave. "Some of 'em are pretty <i>ram</i>bunctious."</p>

<p>They approached the ram with caution, and untied
him. Then Phil started to lead him out of the
orchard, with Dave and Sam following. At first
he would not go, but then began to run, so that
Phil kept up with difficulty.</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried the boy. "Not so fast! Don't
you hear?" But the ram paid no attention, and
now turned to the very end of the orchard. Here
the ground was rough, and in a twinkling all three
of the boys went down in a hollow and rolled over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
and over, while the ram, finding himself free,
plunged on, and was hidden from view in the
darkness.</p>

<p>"He got away!" gasped Phil, scrambling up.
"We must&mdash;Hark!"</p>

<p>He stopped short, and all of the boys listened.
From a distance came the deep baying of the mastiff.
The sounds drew closer rapidly.</p>

<p>"A dog&mdash;and he is after us!" cried Dave.
"Fellows, we have got to get out of this!"</p>

<p>"If we can!" replied Sam Day. "Which is the
way out? I am all turned around."</p>

<p>So were the others, and they stared into the
darkness under the apple trees in perplexity. The
dog was coming closer, and to get away by running
appeared to be out of the question.</p>

<p>"Jump into a tree!" cried Dave, and showed
the way. The others followed, clutching at some
low-hanging branches and pulling themselves up as
rapidly as possible. Dave and Sam were soon
safe, but the mastiff, making a bound, caught Phil
by the sole of his shoe.</p>

<p>"Hi!" roared Phil. "Let go!" And he kicked
out with the other foot. This made the mastiff
make another snap, but his aim was poor, and he
dropped back to the ground, while Phil hauled
himself up beside his companions.</p>

<p>"Phew! but that was a narrow escape and no
mistake," was the comment of the big youth, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
he could catch his breath. "I thought sure he had
me by the foot!"</p>

<p>"We are in a pickle," groaned Sam. "I suppose
that dog will camp right at the foot of this tree till
Farmer Cadmore comes."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is camping now," announced Dave,
peering down into the gloom. The moment the
mastiff saw him, the canine set up a loud barking.</p>

<p>For a full minute after that none of the boys
spoke, each being busy with his thoughts.</p>

<p>"We are treed, that is certain," said Phil, soberly.
"And I must say I don't see any way to
escape."</p>

<p>"Yes, and don't forget about the ram," added
Sam. "Old Jabez Cadmore will want to know
about him, too."</p>

<p>"I've got an idea," said Dave, presently. "Perhaps
it won't work, but it won't do any harm to
try it."</p>

<p>"Give it to us, by all means!"</p>

<p>"The trees are pretty thick in this orchard. Let
us try to work our way from one tree to another
until we can reach the fence. Then, perhaps, we
can drop outside and get out of the way of that
animal."</p>

<p>This was considered a good plan, and they proceeded
to put it into execution at once. It was no
easy matter to climb from tree to tree, and each
got a small rent in his clothing, and Sam came near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
falling to the ground. The mastiff watched them
curiously, barking but little, much to their satisfaction.</p>

<p>At last, they came to the final row of apple trees.
A long limb hung over a barbed-wire fence, and
the boys paused, wondering if it would be safe to
drop to the ground.</p>

<p>"If that mastiff should come through the fence,
it would go hard with us," was Phil's comment.
"I'd rather stay up here and take what comes."</p>

<p>"I am going to risk it," answered Dave. "I see
a stick down there, and I'll grab that as soon as I
land," and down he dropped, and caught up the
stick with alacrity. The dog pounced forward,
struck the sharp barbs of the fence, and retreated,
howling dismally with pain. Then he made another
advance, with like results.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! he can't get through!" ejaculated
Dave. "Come on, fellows, it's perfectly safe."
And down his chums dropped, and all hurried
away from the vicinity of the orchard.</p>

<p>"We had better be getting back," said Sam,
after the orchard and potato patch had been left
behind. "That farmer may be coming after us
before we know it. He must have heard the dog."
But in this he was mistaken, the distance from the
house was too great, and the farmer and his family
slept too soundly to be disturbed.</p>

<p>"It's too bad we must go back without the ram,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
observed Dave. "The other fellows will think we
got scared and threw up the job."</p>

<p>"Well, it can't be helped," began Phil, when he
caught sight of something moving along the road
ahead of them. "Look! Is that the ram?"</p>

<p>"It is!" exclaimed Dave. "Wait! If you are
not careful, he'll run away again. Stay here, and
I'll catch him. I was brought up on a farm, and I
know all about sheep."</p>

<p>The others came to a halt, and Dave advanced
with caution until he was within a few feet of the
ram. Then he held out his hand and made a
peculiar sound. The ram grew curious and remained
quiet, while the youth picked up the end of
the rope which was around the animal's neck.</p>

<p>"I've got him," he said, in a low, even tone.
"Now, keep to the rear and I'll manage him."
And on they went. Once in a while the ram showed
a disposition to butt and to stop short, but Dave
coaxed him, and the trouble was not great.</p>

<p>When they came in sight of the school building,
they realized that the most difficult part of the
task lay before them. It was decided that Dave
should keep the ram behind the gymnasium building
until Sam and Phil ascertained that the coast
was clear.</p>

<p>Left to himself, Dave tied the ram to a post and
crawled into the gymnasium by one of the windows.
He procured several broad straps, and also a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
blanket. Just as he came out with the things, Sam
and Phil came hurrying back, each with a look of
deep concern on his face.</p>

<p>"The jig is up!" groaned Sam. "Plum and
Poole are on to our racket, and they won't let
us in!"</p>

<p>"Plum and Poole!" exclaimed Dave. "Are they
at that back door?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and when we came up, they jeered us," said
Phil. "Oh, but wasn't I mad! They said if we
tried to force our way in, they'd ring up the doctor,
or Mr. Dale."</p>

<p>"Does our crowd know about this?"</p>

<p>"I don't think they do."</p>

<p>"Plum and Poole intend to keep us out all night,
eh?"</p>

<p>"It looks that way. They said we could ask
Haskers to let us in when he came."</p>

<p>"I am not going to Haskers," said Dave, firmly.
"Sam, you look after this ram for a few minutes.
I'll make them let us in, and not give us away,
either. Phil, you come along."</p>

<p>"But I don't see how you are going to do it,"
expostulated the big boy.</p>

<p>"Never mind; just come on, that's all. Plum
isn't going to have a walk-over to-night."</p>

<p>Somewhat mystified, Phil accompanied Dave
across the campus and to the rear door of the Hall.
Here the barrier was open only a few inches, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Plum peering out, and Poole behind him. The
face of the bully wore a look of triumph.</p>

<p>"How do you like staying out?" he whispered,
hoarsely. "Fine night for a ramble, eh? You can
tell old Haskers what a fine walk you have had!
He'll be sure to reward you handsomely!"</p>

<p>"See here, Plum, I am not going to waste words
with you to-night," said Dave, in a low, but intense,
tone. "You let us in, and at once, or you'll
regret it."</p>

<p>"Will I?"</p>

<p>"You will. And what is more: don't you dare
to say a word to anybody about what is happening
now."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, but you can talk big! Maybe you
want me to get down on my knees as you pass in,"
added the bully, mockingly.</p>

<p>"If you don't let us in, do you know what I shall
do?" continued Dave, in a whisper. "I shall go to
Doctor Clay and tell him that you are in the habit
of going out after midnight to row on the river."</p>

<p>If Dave had expected this statement to have an
effect upon the bully, his anticipations were more
than realized. Gus Plum uttered a cry of dismay
and fell back on Nat Poole's shoulder. His face
lost its color, and he shook from head to foot.</p>

<p>"Yo-you&mdash;&mdash;" he began. "Wha-what do you
know about my&mdash;my rowing on the river?"</p>

<p>"I know a good deal."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yo-you've been&mdash;following&mdash;me?" For once
the bully could scarcely speak.</p>

<p>"I shan't say any more," said Dave, giving his
chum a pinch in the arm to keep quiet. "Only, are
you going to let us in or not?"</p>

<p>"N-no&mdash;I mean, yes," stammered Gus Plum.
He could scarcely collect himself, he seemed so
upset. "You can come in. Poole, we'll have to let
them in this time."</p>

<p>"And you will keep still about this?" demanded
Dave.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! I won't say a word, Porter, not a
word! And&mdash;and I'll see you to-morrow after
school. I&mdash;that is&mdash;I want to talk to you. Until
then, mum's the word on both sides." And then,
to the astonishment of both Dave and Phil, Gus
Plum hurried away, dragging Nat Poole with him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE FUN OF A NIGHT</h3>


<p>"My gracious, Plum acts as if he was scared to
death," observed Phil, after the bully and his companion
had departed, leaving the others a clear
field.</p>

<p>"He certainly was worked up," returned Dave.
"I wonder what he'll have to say to-morrow?"</p>

<p>There was no answering that question, and the
two boys hurried to where they had left Sam without
attempting to reach a conclusion. They found
their chum watching out anxiously.</p>

<p>"Well?" came from his lips as soon as he saw
them.</p>

<p>"It's all right," answered Dave, and told as
much as he deemed necessary. "Come, we must
hurry, or Job Haskers will get back before we can
fix things."</p>

<p>"This ram is going to be something to handle,"
observed Phil. "No 'meek as a lamb' about him."</p>

<p>"I'll show you how to do the trick," answered
the boy from the country, and with a dexterous
turn of the horns, threw the ram over on one side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
"Now sit on him, until I tie his legs with the
straps."</p>

<p>In a few minutes Dave had the animal secured,
and the blanket was placed over the ram's head,
that he might not make too much noise. Then they
hoisted their burden up between them and started
toward the Hall.</p>

<p>It was no easy matter to get the ram upstairs and
into Job Haskers' room. On the upper landing
they were met by Roger and Buster Beggs, who
declared the coast clear. Once in the room of the
assistant teacher, they cleared out the bottom of
the closet and then, releasing the animal from his
bonds, thrust him inside and shut and locked the
door, leaving the key in the lock.</p>

<p>"Now, skip!" cried Dave, in a low voice. "He
may cut up high-jinks in another minute."</p>

<p>"Here is an apple he can have&mdash;that will keep
him quiet for awhile," said Roger, and put it
in the closet, locking the door as before. The ram
was hungry, and began to munch the fruit with
satisfaction.</p>

<p>A few minutes more found the boys safe in their
dormitory, where they waited impatiently for the
second assistant teacher to get back to Oak Hall.
At last they heard him unlock the front door and
come up the broad stairs. Then they heard his
room door open and shut.</p>

<p>"Now for the main act in the drama," whis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>pered
Roger. "Come on, but don't dare to make
any noise."</p>

<p>All of the boys, including little Macklin and
Polly Vane, were soon outside of dormitories Nos.
11 and 12&mdash;the two rooms the "crowd" occupied.
They went forth on tiptoe, scarcely daring to
breathe.</p>

<p>Arriving at Job Haskers' door, they listened
and heard the teacher preparing to go to bed. One
shoe after another dropped to the floor, and then
came a creaking of the bed, which told that he had
lain down.</p>

<p>"That ram isn't going to do anything," began
Sam, in disgust, when there came a bang on the
closet door that caused everybody to jump.</p>

<p>"Wha-what's that?" cried Job Haskers, sitting
up in bed. He fancied somebody had knocked on
the door to the hall.</p>

<p>Another bang resounded on the closet door.
The ram had finished the apple, and wanted his
freedom. The teacher leaped to the middle of the
bedroom floor.</p>

<p>"Who is in there?" he demanded, walking
toward the closet. "Who is there, I say?"</p>

<p>Getting no answer, he paused in perplexity.
Then a grin overspread his crafty face, and he
slipped on some of his clothing.</p>

<p>"So I've caught you, eh?" he observed. "Going
to play some trick on me, were you? I am half of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
mind to make you stay there all night, no matter
who you are. I suppose you thought I wouldn't
get back quite so early. In the morning, I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Another bang on the door cut his speculations
short. He struck a match and lit the light, and
then unlocking the closet door, threw it wide open.</p>

<p>What happened next came with such suddenness
that Job Haskers was taken completely by surprise.
As soon as the door was opened, the ram leaped
out. He caught one glimpse of the teacher, and,
lowering his head, he made a plunge and
caught Job Haskers fairly and squarely in the
stomach, doubling up the man like a jack-knife.
Haskers went down in a heap, and, turning, the
ram gave him a second prod in the side.</p>

<p>"Hi! stop! murder! help!" came in terror.
"Stop it, you beast! Hi! call him off, somebody!
Oh, my!" And then Job Haskers tried to arise
and place a table between himself and the ram.
But the animal was now thoroughly aroused, and
went at the table with vigor, upsetting it on the
teacher and hurling both over into a corner.</p>

<p>By this time the noise had aroused nearly the
entire school, and pupils and teachers came hurrying
from all directions.</p>

<p>"What is the trouble here?" demanded Andrew
Dale, as he came up to where Dave was standing.</p>

<p>"Sounds like a bombardment in Mr. Haskers'
room, sir," was the answer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Haskers is trying some new gymnastic
exercises," came from a student in the rear of the
crowd.</p>

<p>"Maybe he has got a fit," suggested another.
"He didn't look well at supper time."</p>

<p>The racket in the room continued, and now
Doctor Clay, arrayed in a dressing-gown and
slippers, came upon the scene, followed by Pop
Swingly, the janitor.</p>

<p>"Has Mr. Haskers caught a burglar?" asked
the janitor.</p>

<p>"That's it!" shouted Phil, with a wink at his
friends. "Look out, Swingly, that you don't get
shot!"</p>

<p>"Shot?" gasped the janitor, who was far from
being a brave man. "I don't want to get shot, not
me!" and he edged behind some of the boys.</p>

<p>Doctor Clay hurried to the door of the room,
only to find it locked from the inside.</p>

<p>"Mr. Haskers, what is the trouble?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Another bang and a thump was the only reply,
accompanied by several yells. Then, of a sudden,
came a crash of glass and an exclamation of
wonder.</p>

<p>"Something has gone through the window, as
sure as you are born!" whispered Dave to Roger.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave, you don't suppose it was Haskers?
If he fell to the ground, he'd be killed!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Open the door, or I shall break in!" thundered
Doctor Clay, and then the door was thrown open
and Job Haskers stood there, a look of misery on
his face and trembling from head to foot.</p>

<p>"What is the trouble?" asked the doctor.</p>

<p>"The ram&mdash;he butted me&mdash;knocked me down&mdash;nearly
killed me!" spluttered the assistant
teacher.</p>

<p>"The ram&mdash;what ram?"</p>

<p>"He's gone now&mdash;hit the window and jumped
out."</p>

<p>"Mr. Haskers, have you lost your senses?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. There was a ram in this room&mdash;in
the closet. I heard him, and opened the door&mdash;I&mdash;oh!
I can feel the blow yet. He was a&mdash;a
terror!"</p>

<p>"Do you mean a real, live ram?" questioned
Andrew Dale, with a slight smile on his face&mdash;that
smile which made all the boys his friends.</p>

<p>"I should say he was alive! Oh, it's no laughing
matter!" growled Job Haskers. "He nearly killed
me!"</p>

<p>"An' did he go through the winder?" asked Pop
Swingly, as he stepped to the broken sash.</p>

<p>"He did&mdash;went out like a rocket. Look at the
wreck of the table! I am thankful I wasn't
killed!"</p>

<p>"How did the ram get here?" asked Doctor
Clay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"How should I know? He was in the closet
when I came in. Some of those villainous
boys&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gently, Mr. Haskers. The boys are not villains."</p>

<p>"Well, they put the ram there, I am sure of
it."</p>

<p>The doctor turned to the janitor.</p>

<p>"Swingly, go below and see if you can see
anything of the ram. He may be lying on the
ground with a broken leg, or something like that.
If so, we'll have to kill him, to put him out of his
misery."</p>

<p>The janitor armed himself with a stout cane and
went downstairs, and after him trooped Andrew
Dale and fully a score of boys. But not a sign of
the ram was to be seen, only some sharp footprints
where he had landed.</p>

<p>"Must have struck fair an' square, an' run off,"
observed the janitor. "Rams is powerful tough
critters. I knowed one as fell over a stone cliff, an'
never minded it at all."</p>

<p>"Let us take a look around," said the first assistant.
"Boys, get to bed, you'll take cold in this
night air." And then the students trooped back
into the Hall.</p>

<p>Upstairs they found that Job Haskers and Doctor
Clay had gotten into a wrangle. The assistant
wanted an examination of the boys at once, regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>less
of the hour of the night, but Doctor Clay
demurred.</p>

<p>"We'll investigate in the morning," said he.
"And, as the window is broken out, Mr. Haskers,
you may take the room next to mine, which is just
now vacant."</p>

<p>"Somebody ought to be punished&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll investigate, do not fear."</p>

<p>"It's getting worse and worse. By and by there
won't be any managing these rascals at all," grumbled
the assistant teacher. "Some of them ought
to have their necks wrung!"</p>

<p>"There, that is enough," returned the doctor,
sternly. "I think we can manage them, even at
such a time as this. Now, boys," he continued,
"go to bed, and do not let me hear any more disturbances."
And he waved the students to their
various dormitories.</p>

<p>"Say, but isn't old Haskers mad!" exclaimed
Roger, when he and his chums were in their dormitory.
"He'd give a good bit to find out who played
the joke on him."</p>

<p>"I hope that ram got away all right," came from
Dave. "I didn't want to see the animal injured."</p>

<p>"I think Pop Swingly is right, animals like that
are tough," was Buster Beggs' comment. "More
than likely he is on his way back to Farmer Cadmore's
farm."</p>

<p>"We'll find out later on," put in Sam Day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is another thing to consider," continued
Dave. "It wouldn't be right to let Doctor Clay
stand for the expense of that broken window. I
think I'll send him the price of the glass out of my
pocket money."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it!" exclaimed Phil. "Let us pass
around the hat. We are all in this as deep as you."
And so it was decided that all of the students of
dormitories Nos. 11 and 12 should contribute to
the fund for mending the broken sash. Then, as
Andrew Dale came around on a tour of inspection,
all hopped into bed and were soon sound asleep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>GUS PLUM'S MYSTERIOUS OFFER</h3>


<p>When Doctor Clay came to his desk on the
following morning, he found an envelope lying
there, on which was inscribed the following:</p>

<p>"To pay for the broken window. If it costs
more, please let the school know, and we'll settle
the bill." Three dollars was inclosed.</p>

<p>This caused the worthy doctor to smile quietly
to himself. It took him back to his college days,
when he had aided in several such scrapes.</p>

<p>"Boys will be boys," he murmured. "They are
not villains, only real flesh-and-blood youngsters."</p>

<p>"You are going to punish those boys?" demanded
Job Haskers, coming up.</p>

<p>"If we can locate them."</p>

<p>"Humph! I'd catch them, if it took all day."</p>

<p>"You may do as you think best, Mr. Haskers;
only remember you have young gentlemen to deal
with. I presume they thought it only a harmless
prank."</p>

<p>"I'll prank them, if I catch them," growled the
assistant to himself, as he walked away.</p>

<p>Word had been passed around among the boys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and when the roll was called all were ready to
"face the music."</p>

<p>"Who knows anything about the proceedings of
last night?" began Job Haskers, gazing around
fiercely.</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then a rather dull boy
named Carson arose.</p>

<p>"Great Cæsar! Is he going to blab on us?"
murmured Phil.</p>

<p>"What have you got to say, Carson?" asked the
teacher.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I kn-know wh-what happened," stuttered
Carson.</p>

<p>"Very well, tell me what you know?"</p>

<p>"A ra-ra-ra-ram got into your ro-ro-ro-room,
and he kno-kno-kno-knocked you d-d-d-down!"
went on the boy, who was the worst stutterer at
Oak Hall.</p>

<p>"Ahem! I know that. Who put the ram in
my room?"</p>

<p>"I d-d-d-d&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You did!" thundered the teacher. "How dare
you do such a thing!"</p>

<p>"I d-d-d-d&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Carson, I am&mdash;er&mdash;amazed. What made you
do it?"</p>

<p>"I d-d-d-didn't say I d-d-d-did it," spluttered
poor Carson. "I said I d-d-d-didn't know."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Job Haskers' face fell, and he looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
as sour as he could. "Sit down. Now, then, whoever
knows who put that ram in my room last night,
stand up."</p>

<p>Not a boy arose.</p>

<p>"Will anybody answer?" stormed the teacher.</p>

<p>There was utter silence, broken only by the ticking
of the clock on the wall. Dave looked at Gus
Plum and Nat Poole, but neither budged.</p>

<p>"I shall call the roll, and each boy must answer
for himself," went on Job Haskers. "Ansberry!"</p>

<p>"I can tell you nothing, Mr. Haskers," was the
reply, and the pupil dropped back into his seat.</p>

<p>"Humph! Aspinwell!"</p>

<p>"I can tell you nothing, Mr. Haskers."</p>

<p>"Babcock!"</p>

<p>"I can tell you nothing, Mr. Haskers."</p>

<p>"This is&mdash;er&mdash;outrageous! Beggs!"</p>

<p>"Sorry, but I can tell you nothing, Mr. Haskers,"
drawled the fat youth.</p>

<p>After that, one name after another was called,
and every pupil said practically the same thing,
even Plum and Poole stating that they could tell
nothing. When the roll-call was finished, the
teacher was fairly purple with suppressed rage.</p>

<p>"I shall inquire into this at some future time!"
he snapped out. "You are dismissed to your
classes." And he turned away to hide his chagrin.</p>

<p>"Do you think we are safe?" whispered Phil to
Dave, as they hurried to their room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think so," was the country boy's reply. And
Dave was right&mdash;the truth concerning the night's
escapade did not come out until long after, when it
was too late to do anything in the matter.</p>

<p>Dave was anxious to make a record for himself
in his studies, and, with the end of the term so close
at hand, he did his best over his books and in the
classroom. He was close to the top of his class,
and he was already certain of winning a special
prize given for mathematics. Roger was just behind
him in the general average, and Phil was but
five points below, with a special prize for language
to his credit. The best scholar of all was Polly
Vane, who, so far, had a percentage of ninety-seven,
out of a possible hundred.</p>

<p>Dave had not forgotten what Gus Plum had
said, and just before the session for the day was
ended received a note from the bully, asking him
to come down to a point on the lake known as the
Three Rocks, and located at the extreme limit of
the academy grounds. Plum asked him particularly
to come alone.</p>

<p>"Aren't you afraid Plum will play some trick on
you?" asked Phil, who saw the note delivered, and
read it.</p>

<p>"I'll be on my guard," answered Dave. "I am
not afraid of him, if it should come to an encounter
between us."</p>

<p>Having put away his books, Dave sauntered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
down to the spot mentioned, which was behind a
thick fringe of bushes. Plum was not yet there,
but soon came up at a quick walk.</p>

<p>"I couldn't get away from Poole," explained
the bully. "Are you alone?" and he gazed around
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am alone," answered Dave, coolly.</p>

<p>There was a silence, and each boy looked at the
other. Dave's eyes were clear, but the bully's had
something of the haunted in them.</p>

<p>"You said something about me last night," began
Plum, lamely, "something about my being on
the river."</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Did you see me on the river?"</p>

<p>"I am not going to answer that question just
yet, Plum."</p>

<p>"Huh! Maybe you are only joking?"</p>

<p>"Very well, you can think as you please. If you
want to talk to me, very well; if not, I'll go back
to the school," and Dave started to walk away.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" The bully caught the country boy
by the arm. "If you saw me on the river, what
else did you see?"</p>

<p>"You were following Shadow Hamilton in a
boat."</p>

<p>"I wasn't&mdash;I didn't have anything to do with
Hamilton. I&mdash;I didn't know he was out till afterwards,"
went on the bully, fiercely. "Don't you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
say such a thing&mdash;don't you dare!" His face was
very white. "You are not going to get me into
trouble!"</p>

<p>"Is that all you have to say, Plum?"</p>

<p>"N-no. I want to talk this over, Porter. I&mdash;that
is&mdash;let us come to terms&mdash;that's the best way.
It won't do you any good to try to get me into
trouble. I&mdash;I haven't done anything wrong. I
was out on the river by&mdash;by accident, that's all&mdash;got
it into my head to have a lark that night, just
as you went out for a lark last night."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want to see me about,
then?" questioned Dave. He could readily see
that the bully had something on his mind which
troubled him greatly.</p>

<p>"I think we might as well come to terms&mdash;you
keep still and I'll keep still."</p>

<p>"I haven't said anything, Plum."</p>

<p>"Yes, but you might, later on, you know. I&mdash;that
is, let us make a sure thing of this," stammered
the bully.</p>

<p>"What are you driving at, Plum? Talk out
straight."</p>

<p>"I will." The bully looked around, to make
certain that nobody was within hearing distance.
"You're a poor boy, Porter, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"I admit it."</p>

<p>"Just so. And, being poor, some pocket money
comes in mighty handy at times, doesn't it?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have some spending money."</p>

<p>"But not as much as you'd like; ain't that so?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I could spend more&mdash;if I had it," answered
Dave, trying to find out what the other was driving
at.</p>

<p>"Well, supposing I promised to give you some
money to spend, Porter, how would that strike
you?"</p>

<p>Dave was astonished, the suggestion was so entirely
unexpected. But he tried not to show his
feelings.</p>

<p>"Would you give me money, Gus?" he asked,
calmly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I would&mdash;if you'd only promise to keep
quiet."</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;I'd do the right thing. Did
Phil Lawrence see me on the river?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Any of the other boys?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of."</p>

<p>"Then you were alone." Gus Plum drew a sigh
of relief. "Now, let us come to terms, by all
means. I'll do the square thing, and you'll have
all the pocket money you want."</p>

<p>"But how much are you willing to give me?"
queried Dave, his curiosity aroused to its highest
pitch.</p>

<p>"I'll give you"&mdash;the bully paused, to add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
impressiveness to his words&mdash;"I'll give you fifty
dollars."</p>

<p>"Fifty dollars!" ejaculated Dave. He was bewildered
by the answer. He had expected Plum to
name a dollar or two at the most.</p>

<p>"Ain't that enough?"</p>

<p>"Do you think it is enough?" asked the country
boy. He scarcely knew what to say. He was trying
to study the bully's face.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;er&mdash;if you'll give me your solemn word
not to whisper a word&mdash;not a word, remember&mdash;I'll
make it a&mdash;a hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"You'll give me a hundred dollars? When?"</p>

<p>"Before the end of the week. I haven't the
money now, but, if you want it, I can give you ten
dollars on account&mdash;just to bind the bargain," and
the bully drew two five-dollar bills from his vest
pocket. "But, remember, mum's the word&mdash;no
matter what comes."</p>

<p>He thrust the bills at Dave, who merely looked
at them. Then the country boy drew himself up.</p>

<p>"I don't want a cent of your money, Gus Plum,"
he said, in a low, but firm, voice. "You can't bribe
me, no matter what you offer."</p>

<p>The bully dropped back and his face fell. He
put his money back into his pocket. Then he glared
savagely at Dave.</p>

<p>"Then you won't come to terms!" he fairly
hissed between his teeth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You had better. If you dare to tell on me&mdash;breathe
a word of what you saw that night&mdash;I'll&mdash;I'll
make it so hot for you that you'll wish you
had never been born! I am not going to let a
country jay like you ruin me! Not much! You
think twice before you make a move! I can hurt
you in a way you least expect, and if I have to leave
this school, you'll have to go, too!" And shaking
his fist at Dave, Gus Plum strode off, leaving Dave
more mystified than ever before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>SHADOW HAMILTON'S CONFESSION</h3>


<p>"I simply can't understand it, Phil. Gus Plum
was frightened very much, or he would never have
offered me a hundred dollars to keep quiet."</p>

<p>Dave and his chum were strolling along the edge
of the campus, an hour after the conversation recorded
in the last chapter. The boy from the poorhouse
had told Phil all that had occurred.</p>

<p>"It is certainly the most mysterious thing I ever
heard of, outside of this mystery about Billy Dill,"
answered Phil. "Plum has been up to something
wrong, but just what, remains to be found out."</p>

<p>"And what about Shadow Hamilton?"</p>

<p>"I can't say anything about Shadow. I never
thought he would do anything that wasn't right."</p>

<p>"Nor I. What would you advise?"</p>

<p>"Keep quiet and await developments. Something
is bound to come to the surface, sooner or
later."</p>

<p>"Hello, you fellows, where are you bound?"
came in a cry, and looking up they saw a well-known
form approaching.</p>

<p>"Ben!" cried Dave, rushing up to the newcomer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and shaking hands warmly. "When did you come
in? And how are all the folks at Crumville? Did
you happen to see Professor Potts and the Wadsworths?"</p>

<p>"One question at a time, please," answered Ben
Basswood, as he shook hands with Phil. "Yes, I
saw them all, and everybody wants to be remembered
to you. Jessie sends her very sweetest regards&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, no fooling," interrupted Dave,
blushing furiously. "Tell us the plain truth."</p>

<p>"Well, she sent her best regard, anyway. And
all the others did the same. The professor is getting
along finely. You'd hardly know him now, he
looks so hale and hearty. It did him a world of
good to go to live with the Wadsworths."</p>

<p>"You must have had a pretty nice vacation,"
observed Phil.</p>

<p>"Yes, although it was rather short. But, say,
have you fellows heard about Plum's father?" went
on Ben Basswood, earnestly.</p>

<p>"We've heard that he lost some money."</p>

<p>"Yes, and he has tied himself up in some sort
of underhanded get-rich-quick concern, and I understand
some folks are going to sue him for all
he is worth. That will be rather rough on Gus&mdash;if
his father loses all his money."</p>

<p>"True enough," said Dave. "But tell us all the
news," he continued, and then Ben related the par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>ticulars
of affairs at Crumville, and of a legal fight
between his father and Mr. Aaron Poole, in which
Mr. Basswood had won.</p>

<p>"That will make Nat more sour on you than
ever," observed Phil.</p>

<p>"Maybe; but I can't help it. If he leaves me
alone I'll leave him alone."</p>

<p>The following day passed quietly at Oak Hall.
Gus Plum and Nat Poole kept by themselves.
Shadow Hamilton appeared to brighten a little,
but Dave observed that the youth was by no means
himself. He did not care to play baseball or "do a
turn" at the gym., and kept for the most part by
himself.</p>

<p>Saturday passed, and on Sunday a large number
of the students marched off to three of the town
churches. Dave, Roger, and Phil attended the
same church and Ben went with them, and all listened
to a strong sermon on Christian brotherhood,
which was destined to do each of them good.</p>

<p>"It makes a fellow feel as if he's got to help
somebody else," said Roger.</p>

<p>"Well, it is our duty to help others," answered
Dave. "The fellow who isn't willing to do that is
selfish."</p>

<p>"You've certainly helped Macklin, Dave," said
Ben. "I never saw such a change in a fellow. I'll
wager he is more than happy to be out of Gus
Plum's influence."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd help Plum, too, if he'd let me," said Dave,
and then gave a long sigh.</p>

<p>Two days later there was a sensation at the
school. Doctor Clay came into the main classroom
in the middle of the forenoon, looking much
worried.</p>

<p>"Young gentlemen, I wish to talk to you for a
few minutes," he said. "As some of you may know,
I am the proud possessor of a stamp collection which
I value at not less than three thousand dollars.
The stamps are arranged in three books, and I
have spent eight years in collecting them. These
books of stamps are missing, and I wish to know if
anybody here knows anything about them. If they
were taken away in a spirit of fun, let me say that
such a joke is a poor one, and I trust the books will
be speedily returned, and without damage to a
single stamp."</p>

<p>All of the boys listened with interest, for many
of them had inspected the collection, and they
knew that stamp-gathering was one of the kind
doctor's hobbies.</p>

<p>"Doctor, I am sorry to hear of this," said one
boy, named Bert Dalgart, a youth who had a small
collection of his own. "I looked at the collection
about ten days ago, as you know. I haven't seen
it since."</p>

<p>"Nor have I seen it," said Roger, who also collected
stamps.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is there any boy here who knows anything at
all about my collection?" demanded the doctor,
sharply. "If so, let him stand up."</p>

<p>There was a pause, but nobody arose. The
master of Oak Hall drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"If this is a joke, I want the collection returned
by to-morrow morning," he went on. "If this is
not done, and I learn who is guilty, I shall expel
that student from this school."</p>

<p>He then passed on to the next classroom, and so
on through the whole academy. But nothing was
learned concerning the missing stamp collection,
and the end of the inquiry left the worthy doctor
much perplexed and worried.</p>

<p>"That is too bad," was Dave's comment, after
school was dismissed. "That was a nice collection.
I'd hate to have it mussed up, if it was mine."</p>

<p>"The fellow who played that joke went too far,"
said the senator's son. "He ought to put the collection
back at once."</p>

<p>The matter was talked over by all the students
for several days. In the meantime Doctor Clay
went on a vigorous hunt for the stamp collection,
but without success.</p>

<p>"Do you think it possible that somebody stole
that collection?" questioned Dave of Phil one afternoon,
as he and his chum strolled in the direction
of Farmer Cadmore's place, to see if they could
learn anything about the ram.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, it's possible; but who would be so mean?"</p>

<p>"Maybe some outsider got the stamps."</p>

<p>"I don't think so. An outside thief would have
taken some silverware, or something like that. No,
I think those stamps were taken by somebody in
the school."</p>

<p>"Then maybe the chap is afraid to return them&mdash;for
fear of being found out."</p>

<p>So the talk ran on until the edge of the Cadmore
farm was gained. Looking into a field, they saw
the ram grazing peacefully on the fresh, green
grass.</p>

<p>"He's as right as a button!" cried Phil. "I
guess he wasn't hurt at all, and after jumping from
the window he came straight home," and in this
surmise the youth was correct.</p>

<p>As the boys walked back to the school they separated,
Phil going to the gymnasium to practice on
the bars and Dave to stroll along the river. The
boy from Crumville wanted to be by himself, to
think over the past and try to reason out what the
sailor had told him. Many a time had Dave tried
to reason this out, but always failed, yet he could
not bear to think of giving up.</p>

<p>"Some time or another I've got to find out who
I am and where I came from," he murmured. "I
am not going to remain a nobody all my life!"</p>

<p>He came to a halt in a particularly picturesque
spot, and was about to sit down, when he heard a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
noise close at hand. Looking through the bushes,
he saw Shadow Hamilton on his knees and with
his clasped hands raised to heaven. The boy was
praying, and remained on his knees for several
minutes. When he arose, he turned around and
discovered Dave, who had just started to leave
the spot.</p>

<p>"Dave Porter!" came in a low cry, and Hamilton's
face grew red.</p>

<p>"Hello, Shadow! Taking a walk along the
river? If you are, I'll go along."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I was walking," stammered the other boy.
His eyes searched Dave's face. "You&mdash;were you
watching me?" he asked, lamely.</p>

<p>"Not exactly."</p>

<p>"But you saw me&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I saw you, Shadow, I couldn't help it. It was
nothing for you to be ashamed of, though."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;oh, I can't tell you!" and Hamilton's
face took on a look of keen misery.</p>

<p>"Shadow, you are in some deep trouble, I know
it," came bluntly from Dave. "Don't you want to
tell me about it? I'll do what I can for you.
We've been chums ever since I came here and I hate
to see you so downcast."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't do any good&mdash;you couldn't help
me."</p>

<p>"Are you sure of that? Sometimes an outsider
looks at a thing in a different light than that person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
himself. Of course, I don't want to pry into your
secrets, if you don't want me to."</p>

<p>Shadow Hamilton bit his lip and hesitated.</p>

<p>"If I tell you something, will you promise to
keep it to yourself?"</p>

<p>"If it is best, yes."</p>

<p>"I don't know if it is best or not, but I don't want
you to say anything."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?"</p>

<p>"You know all about the doctor losing that collection
of stamps?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"And you know about the loss of some of the
class stick-pins about three weeks ago?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know Mr. Dale lost just a dozen of
them."</p>

<p>"The stick-pins are worth two dollars each."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And that stamp collection was worth over
three thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"I know that, too."</p>

<p>"Well, I stole the stick-pins, and I stole the
stamp collection, too!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>ABOUT ATHLETIC CONTESTS</h3>


<p>"You stole those things, you!" gasped Dave.
He could scarcely utter the words. He shrank
back a step or two, and his face was filled with
horror.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did it," came from Shadow Hamilton.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;oh, Shadow, you must be fooling!
Surely, you didn't really go to work and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;" Try
his best, Dave could not finish.</p>

<p>"I stole the things; or, rather, I think I had better
say I took them, although it amounts to the
same thing. But I don't think I am quite as bad as
you suppose."</p>

<p>"But, if you took them, why didn't you return
them? You have had plenty of time."</p>

<p>"I would return them, only I don't know where
the things are."</p>

<p>"You don't know? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I'll have to tell you my whole story, Dave.
Will you listen until I have finished?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Well, to start on, I am a great dreamer and,
what is more, I occasionally walk in my sleep."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, you told me that before."</p>

<p>"One morning I got up, and I found my clothes
all covered with dirt and cobwebs and my shoes
very muddy. I couldn't explain this, and I thought
some of the fellows had been putting up a job on
me. But I didn't want to play the calf, so I said
nothing.</p>

<p>"Some days after that I found my clothing in
the same condition, and I likewise found that my
hands were blistered, as if from some hard work.
I couldn't understand it, but suddenly it flashed on
me that I must have been sleep-walking. I was
ashamed of myself, so I told nobody."</p>

<p>"Well, but this robbery&mdash;&mdash;" began Dave.</p>

<p>"I am coming to that. When Doctor Clay spoke
about his stamp collection, I remembered that I
had dreamed of that collection one night. It
seemed to me that I must run away with the collection
and put it in a safe place. Then I remembered
that I had dreamed of the stick-pins at another
time, and had dreamed of going to the boathouse
to put them in my locker there. That made
me curious, and I went down to the locker, and
there I found&mdash;what do you think? One of the
stick-pins stuck in the wood."</p>

<p>"A new one?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. That made me hunt around thoroughly,
and after a while I discovered this, under
my rowing sweater."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>As Shadow finished, he drew from his pocket a
doubled-up sheet of paper. Dave unfolded it, and
saw it was a large sheet of rare American postage
stamps.</p>

<p>"Did you find any more than this?"</p>

<p>The other youth shook his head.</p>

<p>"Did you hunt all around the boathouse?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I hunted high and low, in the building and
out. I have spent all my spare time hunting; that
is why I have had such poor lessons lately."</p>

<p>"Don't you remember going out to row during
the night, Shadow?"</p>

<p>At this question, Shadow Hamilton started.</p>

<p>"What do you know about that?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Not much&mdash;only I know you were out."</p>

<p>"Do you know where I went to?"</p>

<p>"I do not."</p>

<p>"Well, neither do I. I dreamed about rowing,
but I can't, for the life of me, remember where I
went. I must have gone a good way, for I blistered
my hands with the oars."</p>

<p>"And yet you can't remember?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know it sounds like a fairy tale, and I
know nobody will believe it, yet it is true, Dave,
I'll give you my word on it."</p>

<p>"I believe you, Shadow. Your being out is what
has made you so tired lately. Now you have told
me a secret, I am going to tell you one. Ike Rasmer
saw you out on the river at night, passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Robbin's Point. And there is something stranger
to tell."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"Are you dead certain you were asleep on the
river?"</p>

<p>"I must have been. I remember nothing more
than my dream."</p>

<p>"Do you know that you were followed?"</p>

<p>"By Rasmer?"</p>

<p>"No, by Gus Plum."</p>

<p>"Plum!" gasped Shadow Hamilton, and his face
turned pale. "Are&mdash;are you certain of this?"</p>

<p>"That is what Ike Rasmer told me," and then
Dave related all that the old boatman had
said.</p>

<p>"That makes the mystery deeper," muttered
Shadow. "It puts me in mind of a story I once&mdash;but
I can't tell stories now!" He gave a sigh.
"Oh, Dave, I am so wretched over this! I don't
know what to do."</p>

<p>"I know what I'd do."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Go and tell Doctor Clay everything."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I can't do it. He thought so much of that
stamp collection&mdash;he'll surely send me home&mdash;and
make my father pay for the collection, too."</p>

<p>"I don't think he'll send you home. About pay,
that's another question. In one sense, you didn't
really steal the stamps. A fellow isn't responsible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
for what he does in his sleep. I'd certainly go to
him. If you wish, I'll go with you."</p>

<p>The two talked the matter over for half an hour,
and, on Dave's continual urging, Shadow Hamilton
at last consented to go to Doctor Clay and make a
clean breast of the matter.</p>

<p>They found the master of Oak Hall in his private
office, writing a letter. He greeted them
pleasantly and told them to sit down until he had
finished. Then he turned around to them inquiringly.</p>

<p>It was no easy matter for Shadow Hamilton to
break the ice, and Dave had to help him do it.
But, once the plunge was taken, the youth given to
sleep-walking told him his story in all of its details,
and turned over to the doctor the stick-pin and the
sheet of stamps he had found.</p>

<p>During the recital, Doctor Clay's eyes scarcely
once left the face of the boy who was making the
confession. As he proceeded, Shadow Hamilton
grew paler and paler, and his voice grew husky
until he could scarcely speak.</p>

<p>"I know I am to blame, sir," he said, at last.
"But I&mdash;I&mdash;oh, Doctor Clay, please forgive me!"
he burst out.</p>

<p>"My boy, there is nothing to forgive," was the
kindly answer, that took even Dave by surprise.
"It would seem that you have been as much of a
victim as I have been. I cannot blame you for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
doing these things in your sleep. I take it for
granted that you have told me the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth?"</p>

<p>"I have, sir, I have!"</p>

<p>"Then there is nothing to do but to investigate
this as far as we can. Of course, I realize that it
would cut you to have everybody in the school
know of your sleep-walking habit."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. But I shouldn't care, if only you
could get back the stamps and the pins."</p>

<p>"Is Rasmer sure he saw Plum following Hamilton
on the river?" asked the doctor, turning to
Dave.</p>

<p>"That is what he told Morr, Lawrence, and myself
the day we stopped at his boathouse for a new
oarlock."</p>

<p>"Then I must see him and have a talk with him,"
said the master of Oak Hall; and after a few words
more the boys were dismissed.</p>

<p>On the following morning, Doctor Clay drove
down to Ike Rasmer's place. The boatman was
pleasant enough, but he remembered that Gus Plum
was one of his customers, and when questioned
closely, said he could not testify absolutely to the
fact that it had been Plum who had followed Hamilton
on the river.</p>

<p>"You see, my eyesight ain't of the best, doctor,"
said Rasmer, lamely. "I saw Hamilton full in the
face, but the other feller had his face turned away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
from me. I ain't gittin' nobody into trouble, 'less I
am sure of what I am doin'&mdash;that's nateral, ain't
it?"</p>

<p>"Very," answered Doctor Clay, coldly, and returned
to the academy in deep thought. He realized
that Ike Rasmer was now on his guard, and
would tell no more than was absolutely required
of him.</p>

<p>The next movement of the worthy doctor was
to call Gus Plum into his office. The bully was
anxious, but had evidently nerved himself for the
ordeal.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I have not been out on the river at
night this season," said he, blandly, in reply to the
doctor's question. "I have not dared to go out so
late, for I take cold too easily." And he coughed
slightly.</p>

<p>This was all Doctor Clay could get from Plum,
and he dismissed the bully without mentioning
Hamilton or the missing pins and stamps. Then
the doctor called in Andrew Dale, and the two
consulted together for the best part of an hour; but
what the outcome of that discussion was the boys
were not told. A day later, however, Shadow
Hamilton was told to change his sleeping quarters
to a small room next to that occupied by Andrew
Dale.</p>

<p>"Hello! Shadow is going to get high-toned and
have a sleeping-room all to himself!" cried Roger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and would have asked some questions, only Dave
cut him short.</p>

<p>"There is a good reason, Roger," whispered the
country boy. "But don't ask me to explain now.
If you question Shadow, you'll only hurt his feelings."
This "tip" spread, and none of the boys
after that said a word before Hamilton about the
change. But later all came to Dave and asked
what it meant.</p>

<p>"I wish I could tell you, but I can't, fellows.
Some day, perhaps, you'll know; until then, you'll
have to forget it." And that is all Dave would
say.</p>

<p>The boys were too busy to give the mystery much
attention. A series of athletic contests had been
arranged, and all of the students who were to take
part had gone into training in the gymnasium, and
on the cinder-track which was laid out in the field
beyond the last-named building. The contests were
to come off on the following Saturday, and, to
make matters more interesting, Doctor Clay had
put up several prizes of books and silver medals,
to be presented to the winners.</p>

<p>Dave had entered for a hurdle race, and Roger,
Phil, and Ben were in various other contests. Dave
felt that he would stand a good chance at the hurdles,
for on Caspar Potts' farm he had frequently
practiced at leaping over the rail fences while on the
run. He did not know surely who would be pitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
against him until Ben Basswood brought him the
news.</p>

<p>"Gus Plum, Fanning, and Saultz are in the hurdle
race," said Ben. "Plum says he feels certain he
will win."</p>

<p>"Plum," repeated the country boy. "I knew the
others were in it, but I didn't think Gus would take
part."</p>

<p>"He went in right after he heard that you had
entered. He says he is going to beat you out of
your boots. He wanted to bet with me, but I told
him I didn't bet."</p>

<p>"Is Nat Poole in the race?"</p>

<p>"No, he is in the quarter-mile dash, against me
and six others. He thinks he will win, too."</p>

<p>"I don't think he will, Ben. You can outrun
him."</p>

<p>"Anyway, I am going to try," answered Ben
Basswood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>HOW A RACE WAS WON</h3>


<p>It was a bright, clear day in early summer when
the athletic contests of Oak Hall came off. All the
academy boys assembled for the affair, and with
them were a number of folks from the town, and
also some students from the Rockville Military
Academy, a rival institution of learning, as my old
readers already know.</p>

<p>The contests began with pole vaulting and putting
the shot, and, much to the surprise of all, Chip
Macklin won out over half a dozen boys slightly
larger than himself. Luke Watson also won one of
the contests, and the banjo player and Macklin
were roundly applauded by their friends.</p>

<p>"Dave Porter coached Macklin," said one small
boy to another. "I saw him doing it. I can tell
you, Chip is picking up."</p>

<p>"Yes," was the answer. "And he doesn't seem
to be afraid of that bully of a Plum any more,
either."</p>

<p>After the shot-putting and vaulting came the
quarter-mile dash, for which Ben had entered.</p>

<p>"Go in and win, Ben!" cried Dave, to his old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
chum. "I know you can do it if you'll only
try."</p>

<p>"Nat Poole will win that race!" came roughly
from Gus Plum, who stood near.</p>

<p>"Hi, catch the ball, Gus!" sang out Nat Poole,
from across the field, and threw a ball in Ben's
direction. Plum leaped for the sphere, bumped
up against Ben, and both went down, with the bully
on top.</p>

<p>"Plum, you did that on purpose!" cried Roger,
who was close by. "Shame on you!"</p>

<p>"Shut up! I didn't do it on purpose!" howled
the bully, arising. "Say that again and I'll knock
you down!"</p>

<p>"You certainly did do it on purpose," said Phil,
stepping up quickly. "You ought to be reported
for it."</p>

<p>"Aw, dry up!" muttered Plum, and walked
away.</p>

<p>When Ben arose he could scarcely get his breath.
He was not hurt, but the wind had been knocked
completely out of him.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know if I can ru-run or not!" he
gasped. "He came&mdash;came down on me like a ton
of bricks!"</p>

<p>"Wait, I'll speak to Mr. Dale about this," said
Dave, and ran off. As a result of the interview
the contest was delayed ten minutes&mdash;another taking
its place&mdash;much to the disgust of Gus Plum and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Nat Poole, both of whom had reckoned on putting
Ben out of the contest.</p>

<p>At the start of the quarter-mile dash Nat Poole
and two others forged ahead, but Ben was on his
mettle, and, setting his teeth, soon began to close
up the gap.</p>

<p>"Go it, Ben!" yelled Dave. "You can win, I
know it!"</p>

<p>"Sail right past 'em!" came from the senator's
son. "Hump yourself, old man!"</p>

<p>"Make 'em take the dust!" added Phil.</p>

<p>Ben hardly heard the words, for he was now
running with all his strength. He passed first one
boy and then another, and then came abreast of
Nat Poole. So they moved on to within a dozen
paces of the finish. Then Ben made a leap ahead,
and so did one of the other contestants, and Ben
came in the winner, with the other boy second, and
Nat Poole third. A roar went right across the
field.</p>

<p>"Ben Basswood wins!"</p>

<p>"Jake Tatmon is second!"</p>

<p>"Nat Poole came in only third, and he boasted
he was going to win, sure!"</p>

<p>As soon as the race was over, Nat Poole sneaked
out of sight, behind some friends. He was bitterly
disappointed, and could scarcely keep from running
away altogether.</p>

<p>"You didn't fix him at all," he whispered to Gus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Plum, when he got the chance. "He was in prime
condition."</p>

<p>"I did the best I could&mdash;you saw him go down,
with me on top of him," retorted the bully. "Now,
don't you forget what you promised," he added,
sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll keep my word, don't fear," growled
Nat Poole. "I hate Dave Porter too much to let
him win!"</p>

<p>There were some standing and running jumps,
in which Roger and Phil won second and third
places, and then came the hurdle race, in which
Dave was to participate. In the meantime Nat
Poole had shed his track outfit and donned his
regular clothes and a rather heavy pair of walking
shoes.</p>

<p>"Please let me pass," said he to the crowd in
which Dave was standing, and, without warning,
brought one of his heavy shoes down smartly on
Dave's light, canvas foot-covering.</p>

<p>"Ouch!" cried the country boy, and gave Poole
a quick shove. "What do you mean by stepping
on my foot in that fashion, Nat Poole?"</p>

<p>"Oh, excuse me," said the Crumville aristocrat,
coolly. "Didn't know it was your foot, Porter, or
I shouldn't have stepped on it for anything."</p>

<p>"You've just about lamed me!" gasped Dave.
The pain was still intense.</p>

<p>"Dave, I believe this is a put-up job!" said Ben,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
quickly. "Plum agreed to lame me so that Poole
could win, and now Poole is trying the same trick
on you for Plum's benefit."</p>

<p>"No such thing!" roared Nat Poole, but his face
grew fiery red. "It was a pure accident. I don't
have to lame Porter. Plum will win, anyhow."</p>

<p>"It certainly looks suspicious," said Shadow
Hamilton. "He hadn't any business to force his
way through our crowd."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you put in your oar, you old sleep-walker!"
growled Nat Poole, and then hurried
off and out of sight behind the gymnasium. At the
parting shot Shadow became pale, but nobody
seemed to notice the remark.</p>

<p>"Can you go ahead?" asked Phil, of Dave.</p>

<p>"I think so," was the answer. "But that was a
mean thing to do. He came near crushing my little
toe."</p>

<p>Fortunately, several of the hurdles had not been
properly placed, and it took some little time to
arrange them properly. During that interval
Roger dressed the injured foot for his chum, which
made it feel much better.</p>

<p>"Are you all ready?" was the question put to
the contestants, as they lined up. Then came a
pause, followed by the crack of a revolver, and
they were off.</p>

<p>The encounter with Nat Poole had nerved Dave
as he had seldom been nerved before. Ben had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
won, and he made up his mind to do the same,
regardless of the fact that Gus Plum and one of
the other boys in the race were bigger than himself.
He took the first and second hurdles with ease, and
then found himself in a bunch, with Plum on one
side and a lad named Cashod on the other.</p>

<p>"Whoop her up, Cashod!" he yelled out. "Come
on, and show the others what we can do!"</p>

<p>"Right you are, Porter!" was the answering
cry.</p>

<p>"Not much!" puffed out Gus Plum. "I'm the
winner here!"</p>

<p>"Rats!" answered Dave. "You'll come in fifth,
Plum. You're winded already!" And then, with
a mighty effort, he leaped to the front, with Cashod
on his heels. "Poole didn't do your dirty work
well enough," he flung back over his shoulder as he
took his fourth hurdle.</p>

<p>The taunts angered Gus Plum, and this made
him lose ground, until, almost before he knew it,
the third pupil in the race dashed past him. Then
he found himself neck-and-neck with the fifth contestant.</p>

<p>"Here they come!"</p>

<p>"Dave Porter is ahead, with Cashod second!"</p>

<p>"Collins has taken third place!"</p>

<p>"Plum and Higgins are tied for fourth place!"</p>

<p>"Not much! Higgins is ahead!"</p>

<p>"And there goes Sanderson ahead of Plum, too!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Phew! Wonder if that is what Plum calls winning?
He had better study his dictionary!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 404px;">

<span class="caption">Dave cleared the last hurdle and came in a winner.&mdash;

</div>

<p>With a mighty leap Dave cleared the last hurdle,
and came in a winner. Then the others finished
in the order named, excepting that Gus Plum was
so disgusted that he refused to take the last hurdle,
for which some of the boys hissed him, considering
it unsportsmanlike, which it was.</p>

<p>"My shoe got loose," said the bully, lamely. "If
it hadn't been for that, I should have won." But
nobody believed him.</p>

<p>"Dave, the way you went ahead was simply
great," cried Phil. "It was as fine a hurdle race
as I ever saw."</p>

<p>"Yes, and he helped me, too," said Cashod. "I
was thinking Plum would go ahead, until Porter
laughed at him. It was all right," and Cashod
bobbed his head to show how satisfied he was.</p>

<p>If Nat Poole had been disgusted Gus Plum was
more so, and he lost no time in disappearing from
public gaze. The two cronies met back of the
gymnasium.</p>

<p>"You hurt Porter about as much as I hurt Basswood,"
Plum grumbled. "If you can't do better
than that next time, you had better give up trying."</p>

<p>"Oh, 'the pot needn't call the kettle black,'"
retorted Poole. "You made just as much of a mess
of it as I did. We'll be the laughing stock of the
Porter crowd now."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"If they laugh at me, I'll punch somebody's nose.
As it is, I've got an account to settle with Porter,
and I am going to settle it pretty quick, too."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"He jeered me while we were in the race.
He has got to take it back, or there is going to be
trouble," muttered the bully, clenching his fists.</p>

<p>In his usual bragging way Gus Plum let several
students know that he "had it in" for Dave, and
this reached the country boy's ears the next day
directly after school.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of him," said Dave, coolly.
"If he wants to find me, he knows where to look
for me."</p>

<p>Shortly after this Dave and some of his chums
took a walk down to the boathouse dock. There
they ran into Plum, Poole, and several of their
admirers.</p>

<p>"Here is Porter now!" said one boy, in a low
voice. "Now is your chance, Gus."</p>

<p>"Yes, let us see you do what you said," came
from another.</p>

<p>Plum had not expected an encounter so soon, but
there seemed to be no way of backing out, so he
advanced quickly upon Dave, and clenched his fists.</p>

<p>"You can fight, or apologize," he said, loudly.</p>

<p>"Apologize, to <i>you</i>?" queried Dave, coolly.</p>

<p>"Yes, to me, and at once," blustered the bully.</p>

<p>"I am not apologizing to you, Plum."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you'll fight."</p>

<p>"If you hit me, I shall defend myself."</p>

<p>"Hit you? If I sail into you, you'll think a
cyclone struck you. If you know where you are
wise, you'll apologize."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, Plum, I want to let you and all
here know what I think of you. You are a bully, a
braggart&mdash;and a coward!"</p>

<p>Dave's eyes were flashing dangerously, and as
he gazed steadily at Plum, the latter backed away
a step.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you dare to talk to me like that?"</p>

<p>"Why not? Nobody ought to be afraid to tell
the truth."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't stand gassing!" burst out Nat Poole.
"Give it to him, Gus&mdash;give it to him good and
hard."</p>

<p>"I will!" cried the bully, and making a quick
leap, he delivered a blow straight for Dave's face.</p>

<p>Had the blow landed as intended, the country
boy would undoubtedly have sustained a black eye.
But Dave ducked slightly, and the bully's fist shot
past his ear. Then Dave drew off and hit Plum a
stinging blow on the chin.</p>

<p>"A fight! A fight!" was the rallying cry from
all sides, and in a twinkling a crowd assembled to
see the impromptu contest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>A FIGHT AND ITS RESULT</h3>


<p>"Dave, if you fight, and Doctor Clay hears of
it, you'll get into trouble," whispered Roger. "You
know what his rules are."</p>

<p>"I am not going to fight, but I'll defend myself,"
was the calm answer.</p>

<p>"Maybe you're afraid to fight," sneered Nat
Poole, who stood close by.</p>

<p>Before the country youth could answer, Gus
Plum sprang forward and aimed another blow at
Dave's face. Dave ducked, but was not quite quick
enough, and the fist of his enemy landed on his ear.</p>

<p>This aroused the boy from Crumville as never
before. The look on the bully's face was such as to
nerve him to do his best, and, casting prudence to
the winds, he "sailed in" with a vigor that astonished
all who beheld it. One fist landed on Plum's
nose and the other on the bully's chin, and down he
went in a heap against the boathouse.</p>

<p>"Have you had enough?" demanded Dave, his
eyes fairly flashing.</p>

<p>"No!" roared the bully, and scrambling up, he
rushed at Dave, and the pair clenched. Around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
and around the little dock they wrestled, first one
getting a slight advantage and then the other.</p>

<p>"Break away!" cried some of the students.
"Break away!"</p>

<p>"I'll break, if he'll break!" panted Dave. Plum
said nothing, for he was doing his best to get the
country boy's head in chancery, as it is termed;
that is, under his arm, where he might pummel it
to his satisfaction.</p>

<p>But Dave was on his guard, and was not to be
easily caught. He knew a trick or two, and, watching
his opportunity, led Plum to believe that he
was getting the better of the contest. Then, with
remarkable swiftness, he made a half-turn, ducked
and came up, and sent the bully flying clean and
clear over his shoulder. When this happened both
were close to the edge of the dock, and, with a cry
and a splash, Gus Plum went over into the river.</p>

<p>"Gracious! did you see that fling!"</p>

<p>"Threw him right over his head into the river!"</p>

<p>"The fellow who tackles Dave Porter has his
hands full every time!"</p>

<p>So the comments ran on. In the meantime Dave
stood quietly on the edge of the dock, watching for
the bully, and trying to regain his breath.</p>

<p>Plum had disappeared close to the edge of the
dock, and all the bystanders expected him to reappear
almost immediately. But, to their surprise, he
did not show himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is he? Why doesn't he come up?"</p>

<p>"He must be playing a trick on Porter. Maybe
he is under the dock."</p>

<p>"No, he can't get under the dock. It is all
boarded up."</p>

<p>"He must have struck his head on something, or
got a cramp, being so heated up."</p>

<p>Dave continued to wait, and as his enemy did
not come to light, a cold chill ran over him. What
if Plum was really hurt, or in trouble under water?
He knew that the bully was not the best of
swimmers.</p>

<p>"There he is!" came in a shout from one of the
boys, and he pointed out into the stream, to where
Gus Plum's body was floating along, face downward.</p>

<p>Dave gave one look and his heart seemed to leap
into his throat. By the side of the dock was a rowboat,
with the oars across the seats. He made a
bound for it.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, motioning to Roger, and the
senator's son followed him into the craft. They
shoved off with vigor, and Dave took up the oars.
Then another boat put off, containing Poole and
two other students.</p>

<p>A few strokes sufficed to bring the first rowboat
up alongside of the form of the bully. Plum had
turned partly over and was on the point of sinking
again, when Roger reached out and caught him by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the foot. Then Dave swung the rowboat around,
and after a little trouble the two got the soaked
one aboard.</p>

<p>Gus Plum was partly unconscious, and a bruise
on his left temple showed where his head had struck
some portion of the dock in falling. As they placed
him across the seats of the rowboat, he gasped,
spluttered, and attempted to sit up.</p>

<p>"Better keep still," said Dave, kindly. "We
don't want the boat to go over."</p>

<p>"Where am I? Oh, I know now! You knocked
me over."</p>

<p>"Don't talk, Plum; wait till we get back to
shore," warned Roger.</p>

<p>A few strokes took the boat back to the dock,
and Dave and Roger assisted the dripping youth
to land. Gus Plum was so weak he had to sit down
on a bench to recover.</p>

<p>"You played me a mean trick," he spluttered, at
last. "A mean trick!"</p>

<p>"That's what he did," put in Nat Poole, who
had also returned to the dock. "I guess he was
afraid to fight fair."</p>

<p>"I suppose you wanted to drown me," went on
the bully of Oak Hall.</p>

<p>"I didn't want to drown you, Plum&mdash;I didn't
even want to push you overboard. I didn't think
we were so close to the dock's edge."</p>

<p>"Humph! It's easy enough to talk!" Gus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Plum gazed ruefully at his somewhat loud summer
suit. "Look at my clothes. They are just about
ruined!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," came from Roger. "They need
drying, cleaning, and pressing, that's all. You
can get the job done down in Oakdale for a dollar
and a half."</p>

<p>"And who is going to pay the bill?"</p>

<p>"Well, if you are too poor to do it, I'll do so,"
answered Roger.</p>

<p>This reply made the bully grow very red, and he
shook his fist at the senator's son.</p>

<p>"None of your insinuations!" he roared. "I
am not poor, and I want you to know it. My
father may have lost some money, but he can still
buy and sell your father. And as for such a
poorhouse nobody as your intimate friend there,
Porter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For shame, Plum!" cried several.</p>

<p>"Oh, go ahead and toady to him, if you want to.
I shan't stop you. But I'd rather pick my company."</p>

<p>"And so would I," added Nat Poole. "I once
heard of a poorhouse boy who was the son of a
thief. I'd not want to train with a fellow of that
sort."</p>

<p>Dave listened to the words, and they seemed to
burn into his very heart. He came forward with
a face as white as death itself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nat Poole, do you mean to insinuate that I am
the son of a thief?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Oh, a fellow don't know what to think," replied
the Crumville aristocrat, with a sneer.</p>

<p>"Then take that for your opinion."</p>

<p>It was a telling blow, delivered with a passion
that Dave could not control. It took Nat Poole
squarely in the mouth, and the aristocrat went down
with a thud, flat on his back. His lip was cut and
two of his teeth were loosened, while the country's
boy's fist showed a skinned knuckle.</p>

<p>"Whoop! did you see that!"</p>

<p>"My! what a sledge-hammer blow!"</p>

<p>"Poole is knocked out clean!"</p>

<p>Such were some of the comments, in the midst
of which Nat Poole sat up, dazed and bewildered.
Then he gasped, and ejected some blood from his
mouth.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Stay where you are, Nat Poole," said Dave, in
a voice that was as cold as ice. "Don't you dare
to budge!"</p>

<p>"Wha-what?"</p>

<p>"Don't you dare to budge until you have begged
my pardon."</p>

<p>"Me? Beg your pardon! I'd like to see myself!"</p>

<p>"Well, that is just what you are going to do! If
you don't, do you know what I'll do? I'll throw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
you into the river and keep you there until you do
as I say."</p>

<p>"Here, you let him alone!" blustered Plum,
starting to rise.</p>

<p>"Keep out of this, Plum, or, as sure as I'm standing
here, I'll throw you in again, too!" said Dave.</p>

<p>"Dave&mdash;&mdash;" whispered Roger. He could see
that his friend was almost beside himself with
passion.</p>

<p>"No, Roger, don't try to interfere. This is my
battle. They have been talking behind my back
long enough. Poole has got to apologize, or take
the consequences, and so has Plum. I'll make them
do it, if I have to fight them both!" And the eyes
of the country boy blazed with a fire that the senator's
son had never before seen in them. "I don't
deny that I came from the poorhouse, and I don't
deny that I know nothing of my past," went on
Dave, speaking to the crowd. "But I am trying
to do the fair thing, every boy here knows it, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We are with you, Dave!" came from the rear
of the crowd, and Luke Watson pushed his way to
the front, followed by Phil, Shadow, and Buster
Beggs.</p>

<p>"Dave Porter is one of the best fellows in this
school," cried Phil.</p>

<p>"And Plum and Poole are a couple of codfish,"
added Buster.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;am a codfish, am I?" roared Plum.</p>

<p>"You are, Gus Plum. You say things behind
folks' backs and try to bully the little boys, and in
reality you are no better than anybody else, if as
good. You make me sick."</p>

<p>"I'll&mdash;I'll hammer you good for that!"</p>

<p>"All right, send me word when you are ready,"
retorted Buster.</p>

<p>In the meantime Dave was still standing over
Nat Poole. Suddenly he caught the aristocratic
youth by the ear and gave that member a twist.</p>

<p>"Ouch! Let go!" yelled Nat Poole. "Let go!
Don't wring my ear off!"</p>

<p>"Will you apologize?" demanded Dave, and
gave the ear a jerk that brought tears to Poole's
eyes.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;oh, you'll have my ear off next! Oh,
you wait&mdash;oh! oh! If I ever get&mdash;<i>ouch</i>!"</p>

<p>"Say you are sorry you said what you did to
me," went on Dave, "or into the river you go!"
And despite Poole's efforts, he dragged the aristocrat
toward the edge of the dock.</p>

<p>"No! no! Oh, I say, Porter! Oh, my ear! I
don't want to go into the river! I&mdash;I&mdash;I take it
back&mdash;I guess I made a mistake. Oh, let me go!"</p>

<p>"You apologize, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then get out, and after this behave yourself,"
said Dave, and gave Nat Poole a fling that sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
him up against the boathouse with a bang. In
another instant he was by Gus Plum's side. "Now
it's your turn, you overgrown bully," he continued.</p>

<p>"Wha-what do you mean?" stammered Plum,
who had looked on the scene just enacted with a
sinking heart.</p>

<p>"I mean you must apologize, just as Poole has
done."</p>

<p>"And if I won't?"</p>

<p>"I'll thrash you till you do&mdash;no matter what the
consequences are," and Dave hauled off his jacket
and threw off his cap.</p>

<p>"Would you hit a fellow when he is&mdash;er&mdash;half
drowned?" whined the bully.</p>

<p>"You're not half drowned&mdash;you're only scared,
Plum. Now, then, will you apologize or not?"
And Dave doubled up his fists.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't have to. I&mdash;I&mdash;<i>oh</i>!"</p>

<p>The words on Plum's lips came to a sudden end,
for at that instant the country boy caught him by
the throat and banged his head up against the
boathouse side.</p>

<p>"Now apologize, and be quick about it," said
Dave, determinedly.</p>

<p>"Oh, my head! You have cracked my skull!
I'll&mdash;I'll have the law on you!"</p>

<p>"Very well, I'm willing. But you must apologize
first!" And Plum's head came into contact
with the boathouse side again, and he saw stars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! Let up&mdash;stop, Porter! Don't kill me!
I&mdash;I&mdash;take it back! I&mdash;I apologize! I&mdash;I didn't
mean anything! Let up, please do!" shrieked Gus
Plum, and then Dave let go his hold and stepped
back.</p>

<p>"Now, Gus Plum, listen to me," said the country
boy. "Let this end it between us. If you don't, let
me tell you right now that you will get the worst
of it. After this, keep your distance and don't
open your mouth about me. I shan't say anything
to Doctor Clay about this, but if you say anything,
I'll tell him all, and I know, from what he has
already said, that he will stand by me."</p>

<p>"Maybe he doesn't know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He knows everything about my past, and he
has asked me to stay here, regardless of what some
mean fellows like you might say about it. But I
am not going to take anything from you and Poole
in the future; remember that!" added Dave, and
then he picked up his cap and jacket, put them on,
and, followed by Phil, Roger, and a number of his
other friends, walked slowly away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>SHADOW AS A SOMNAMBULIST</h3>


<p>The manner in which Dave had brought Gus
Plum and Nat Poole to terms was the talk of Oak
Hall for some time, and many of the pupils looked
upon the country boy as a veritable leader and
conqueror.</p>

<p>"I wish I had been there," said Chip Macklin
to Roger. "It must have been great to see Plum
and Poole eat humble pie. What do you think
they'll do about it?"</p>

<p>"They won't do anything, just at present," answered
the senator's son. "They are too scared."
And in this surmise, Roger was correct.</p>

<p>But, though the majority of the students sided
with Dave, there was a small class, made up of
those who were wealthy, who passed him by and
snubbed him, not wishing to associate with anybody
who had come from a poorhouse. They said
nothing, but their manners were enough to hurt
Dave greatly, and more than once the country boy
felt like packing his trunk and bidding good-by to
Oak Hall forever. But then he would think of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
many friends and of what kind-hearted Doctor
Clay had said, and grit his teeth and declare to
himself that he would fight the battle to the end,
no matter what the cost.</p>

<p>If the story of the encounter came to the ears of
the master of the school or the teachers, nothing
was said about it, and, in the multitude of other
events coming up, the incident was forgotten by the
majority. But Dave did not forget, and neither
did Plum and Poole.</p>

<p>"Oh, how I detest that chap!" grumbled Poole
to Plum, one night when they were alone. "Gus,
we must get square."</p>

<p>"That's right," returned the bully. "But not
now. Wait till he is off his guard, then we can fix
him, and do it for keeps, too!"</p>

<p>On the following Saturday evening Chip Macklin
called Dave to one side. The young student
was evidently excited over something.</p>

<p>"What is it, Chip?" asked Dave. "Hurry up,
I can't wait long, for I want to join the fellows in
the gym."</p>

<p>"I want to tell you something about Gus Plum,"
was the answer. "I think I've discovered something,
but I am not sure."</p>

<p>"Well, out with it."</p>

<p>"This afternoon I got permission to ride over to
Rockville on my bicycle, to get some shirts at the
furnishing store there. Well, when I came out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the store, I saw Gus Plum coming out of the post-office
on the opposite side of the street. He had
some letters in his hand, and he turned into the
little public park near by, sat down on a bench, and
began to read them."</p>

<p>"Well, what is remarkable about that, outside
of the fact that he is supposed to get all his letters
in the Hall mail?" remarked Dave.</p>

<p>"That's just it. I made up my mind something
was wrong, or else he'd have his mail come here.
I saw him tear three of the envelopes to pieces and
scatter the bits in the grass. When he went away,
I walked over to the spot and picked up such bits
of paper as I could find. Of course, you may say
I was a sneak for doing it, but just look at what I
found."</p>

<p>"I have no desire, Chip, to pry into Plum's private
affairs."</p>

<p>"Yes, but this is not his private affair&mdash;to my
way of thinking. It concerns the whole school,"
returned Chip Macklin, eagerly.</p>

<p>Dave glanced at the bits of paper, and at once
became interested. One piece contained the words,
"Stamp Dealer"; another, "Rare Sta&mdash; w York,"
and another, "Stamps Bought and Sold by Isaac
Dem&mdash; &mdash;nett Street, Sa&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"These must have come from dealers in stamps,"
said Dave, slowly.</p>

<p>"That is what I thought."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you ever know Gus Plum to be interested
in stamps?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Were the letters addressed to him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Strange as it may seem, I
couldn't find any of the written-on portions of the
envelopes."</p>

<p>"Did Plum see you?"</p>

<p>"Not until later&mdash;when I was on my way back
to the Hall."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. He acted as if he wanted to avoid
me."</p>

<p>After this the pair talked the matter over for
several minutes, but could reach no satisfactory
conclusion regarding the bits of paper.</p>

<p>"Do as you think best, Chip," said Dave, at last.
"If you want to go to Doctor Clay, I fancy he will
be glad to hear what you have to say."</p>

<p>"Well, if Plum has those lost stamps, don't you
think he should be made to return them?"</p>

<p>"By all means. But you've got to prove he has
them first, and the doctor won't dare to say anything
to Plum until he is sure of what he is doing.
Otherwise, Plum's father could raise a big row,
and he might even sue the doctor for defamation
of character, or something like that."</p>

<p>A little later found Chip Macklin in the doctor's
office. The small boy was rather scared, but told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
a fairly straight story, and turned over the bits of
paper to the master of the Hall. Doctor Clay was
all attention.</p>

<p>"I will look into this," he said. "In the meantime,
Macklin, I wish you would keep it to yourself."</p>

<p>"I have already told Dave Porter about it. I
wanted his advice."</p>

<p>"Then request Porter to remain quiet, also," and
Chip said that he would do as asked, and later on
did so.</p>

<p>The end of the school term was now close at
hand, and Dave turned to his studies with renewed
vigor, resolved to come out as near to the head of
the class as possible. He received several letters
from Professor Potts, Mr. Wadsworth, and a delicately
scented note from Jessie, and answered them
all without delay. The letter from Jessie he prized
highly, and read it half a dozen times before
he stowed it carefully away among his few valued
possessions.</p>

<p>On Wednesday evening Dave partook rather
freely of some hash that was served up. On the
sly, Sam Day salted his portion, and, as a consequence,
the country boy went to bed feeling remarkably
thirsty. He drank one glass of water, and an
hour later got up to drink another, only to find the
water pitcher empty.</p>

<p>"It's no use, I've got to have a drink," he told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
himself. "And if I catch the fellow who salted my
hash&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He slipped into part of his clothing, and, taking
the water pitcher, made his way through the hallway
to the nearest of the bathrooms. Here he
obtained the coldest drink possible, and then, filling
the pitcher, started to return to dormitory No. 12.</p>

<p>As he neared the dormitory, he saw somebody
pass along the other end of the hallway. It was
a boy, fully dressed, and with a cap set back on
his head.</p>

<p>"Shadow Hamilton!" he murmured, as the boy
passed close to a dimly burning hall light. "Now,
what is he up to?"</p>

<p>He put down his pitcher and stole forward, until
he was directly behind Shadow. Then, of a sudden,
he beheld the boy swing around and put out
his hands, feeling for the rail of a rear stairs.
Shadow Hamilton was fast asleep.</p>

<p>"He is doing some more of his sleep-walking!"
thought Dave. "Now, what had I best do?"</p>

<p>There was no time to think long, for the sleep-walker
was already descending the back stairs
slowly and noiselessly. Dave hurried into the
dormitory, set down the pitcher, and aroused
Roger, who was nearest to him.</p>

<p>"Come, quick!" he whispered. "Slip on your
clothes, and don't make any noise."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm too sleepy for fun!" murmured Roger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"This isn't fun, it's important. Come, I say!"</p>

<p>Thus aroused, the senator's son rolled from his
couch and hurried into his clothing. In a few minutes
both boys had their shoes and caps on, and
along the hallway they sped, and down the back
stairs. The door below was unlocked, but closed.
Soon they were out in the rear yard of the Hall,
and there they beheld Shadow Hamilton walking
slowly in the direction of the boathouse.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" whispered Roger.</p>

<p>"It is Shadow. He is walking in his sleep. I
want to find out where he is going and what he'll
do."</p>

<p>"Humph! This certainly is interesting," answered
the senator's son.</p>

<p>"Whatever you do, Roger, don't arouse him, or
there may be an accident," cautioned Dave. "Let
him go his own way."</p>

<p>"But he may hurt himself, anyway."</p>

<p>"No, he won't. A sleep-walker can walk a slack
wire, if he tries it, and never tumble. Haven't you
heard of them walking on the ridge pole of a
house? I have."</p>

<p>"I've read about such things. And I know they
say you mustn't arouse them. He is going into the
boathouse!"</p>

<p>The chums ran forward and reached the doorway
of the boathouse just as Shadow Hamilton
was coming out. The somnambulist had a pair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
oars, and he stepped to the edge of the dock and
untied one of the boats and leaped in.</p>

<p>"I must find them!" they heard the youth mutter
to himself. "I must find them and bring them
back!"</p>

<p>"Did you hear that?" asked Roger. "What is
he talking about?"</p>

<p>"That remains to be found out. Come, let us
follow him," returned Dave.</p>

<p>They procured two pairs of oars, and were soon
in another boat and pulling behind Shadow Hamilton.
The boy who was asleep seemed to possess
supernatural strength, and they had no easy time of
it keeping up with him. His course was up the
Leming River, past Robbin's Point, and then into
a side stream that was rather narrow, but almost
straight for a distance of two miles.</p>

<p>"Do you know where this stream leads to?"
questioned Roger.</p>

<p>"I do not."</p>

<p>"Almost to the old castle that we visited last
winter on our skates, the day we caught that robber
and saved Billy Dill. The river makes half a
dozen twists and turns before the castle is reached,
but this is a direct route and much shorter."</p>

<p>"Can it be possible that Shadow is going to the
old castle?" queried the country boy.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know. We'll learn pretty
soon."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>As my old readers know, the place referred to
was a dilapidated structure of brick and stone
which had been erected about the time of the Revolutionary
War. It set back in a wilderness of
trees, and was given over largely to the owls and
to tramps. It belonged to an unsettled estate that
had gone into litigation, and there was no telling
if it would ever be rebuilt and occupied in a
regular way.</p>

<p>It was dark under the trees, but by pulling close
to the boat ahead, Dave and Roger managed to
keep Shadow Hamilton in sight. As soon as the
somnambulist came near to the castle he ran his
boat up the bank, leaped ashore, and stalked toward
the building.</p>

<p>"He has disappeared!" cried Roger, softly.</p>

<p>"I see him," answered Dave. "Come!" and he
led the way into the old structure and to the very
rooms where the encounter with the robber and
with Billy Dill had occurred.</p>

<p>Scarcely daring to breathe, they watched Shadow
move around in an uncertain way, touching this
object and that, and opening and shutting several
closet doors, and even poking into the chimney-place.</p>

<p>"Gone! gone! gone!" they heard him mutter.
"What shall I do? What shall I do?" And he
gave a groan.</p>

<p>Five minutes passed and the sleep-walker left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the castle and hurried to his boat. His course was
now down the stream toward the Hall, and Dave
and Roger followed, as before. At the dock the
boats were tied up, the oars put away, and Shadow
Hamilton went back to the room from which he
had come. Peering in, Dave and Roger saw him
undress and go to bed, just as if nothing out of the
ordinary had occurred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>A PHOTOGRAPH OF IMPORTANCE</h3>


<p>"I should not believe it, had I not seen it with
my own eyes."</p>

<p>It was in this fashion that Roger expressed himself
on the following day, when discussing the
affair of the night previous with Dave. Shadow
was around, as usual. He looked sleepy, but otherwise
acted as if nothing out of the ordinary had
happened.</p>

<p>"It certainly is remarkable," was Dave's comment.
"The question is, what made him go to the
castle? I think I know, but I cannot speak about
it. But I'll tell you what I should like to do,
Roger: go up to the castle while it is daylight and
take a thorough look around."</p>

<p>Roger was willing to do this, and the upshot of
the talk was that Dave and the senator's son paid
the old brick-and-stone structure a visit on the following
Saturday half-holiday, taking Phil and Ben
with them. They went up in a boat by the short
route, arriving there about half-past three o'clock.</p>

<p>There was not a soul about the deserted mansion,
and the few birds flew away at their approach. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
was a clear, sunny day, and they lost no time in
throwing every door and window wide open, so
that they might have the full benefit of the light
and fresh air.</p>

<p>"Here is the room in which he moved around the
most," remarked Roger, gazing around earnestly.
"But I can't say that I see anything unusual, do
you?"</p>

<p>They were all searching around, and after a few
minutes had passed Ben uttered a low cry and
held up a small object, almost covered with dust
and dirt.</p>

<p>"A class pin!" cried Dave. "We must see if we
can find any more of them."</p>

<p>It was not long before Phil came upon two pins
sticking on a board of a closet. Then Roger ran
into the next room and, after a short hunt, uncovered
a flat pasteboard box with several more of
the class pins, each a bit tarnished by the dampness,
but otherwise uninjured.</p>

<p>"He must have come for the pins," said Ben.
"That solves the mystery of how they disappeared
from Mr. Dale's possession."</p>

<p>"Here is a postage stamp!" ejaculated Phil, and
held it up. "It's an old German issue," he added.
"And here are half a dozen others, all evidently
torn from a sheet. Boys, Shadow must have taken
the doctor's collection!"</p>

<p>Dave said nothing to this, for he had discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
a cupboard in a corner, tightly closed and with the
wooden button of the door missing. He now
opened the door of the cupboard with a knife.</p>

<p>"Hello, what's in there?" asked Roger, who
was behind him.</p>

<p>"Seems to be some clothing," answered Dave,
and hauled forth some loose garments and also an
old satchel. The garments formed part of a sailor's
garb, and the satchel was marked on the bottom
with the name, "William Dill."</p>

<p>"It's Billy Dill's missing outfit!" cried Dave,
eagerly. "Oh, Roger, how glad I am that I have
found this! It's the best yet!"</p>

<p>All the boys were interested, for they knew
Dave's story and the tale of the strange sailor.
As Dave ran to the light with the satchel, they
crowded around him.</p>

<p>"I think I am fully justified in opening this grip,"
said the country boy. He was so agitated he could
scarcely speak.</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," cried Phil. "Open it, by all
means. It may throw light on some things which
Billy Dill has been unable to explain."</p>

<p>The satchel was not locked and came open with
ease. Inside was a bag containing some loose silver
and a roll of forty-six dollars in bankbills. There
was also a locket, containing the picture of a
motherly old lady, probably the sailor's parent.
Under the locket were a small Bible and a work on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
ocean navigation, and at the bottom a thick, brown
envelope containing a photograph.</p>

<p>"Let us see whose picture that is," said Phil, and
Dave opened the envelope and drew the photograph
forth. As he held it up there was a general
cry, in which he was forced to join.</p>

<p>"That's the man who looks like you, Dave!"
cried Roger.</p>

<p>"What a striking resemblance!" exclaimed Phil.</p>

<p>"And he has the mustache, just as the sailor
said," added Ben. "Dave, that man looks enough
like you to be your older brother, or your father!"</p>

<p>Dave said nothing, for he was too much overcome
to speak. As he gazed at the picture, he
began to tremble from head to foot. Taking away
the mustache, the face was exactly like his own,
only older and more careworn. He did not wonder
that Billy Dill had become confused because of
the resemblance. He turned the picture over.
There was not a scrap of printing or writing on
it anywhere.</p>

<p>What was the meaning of this mystery? What
was this man to him? Was he the man who
had once lost a child through a crazy nurse? In
his perplexed state of mind, the questions were
maddening ones to the boy.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it, Dave?" asked Phil,
after a pause, and the eyes of all the others were
turned on the poorhouse boy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do I think of it?" he repeated, slowly.
"I think this: I am going to find this man, if he is
alive, even if I have to go around the world to do
it. He must know something of my past&mdash;most
likely he is a relative of mine. I am going to be a
poorhouse nobody no longer. I am going to establish
my identity&mdash;and I am going to do that before
I do anything else."</p>

<p>Dave spoke deliberately, weighing every word.
It was almost as if he was registering a vow. The
others saw a look of determination settle on his
face, and knew that he would do as he said.</p>

<p>The boy from the country had suddenly lost
interest in clearing up the mystery surrounding
Shadow Hamilton, and allowed the others to finish
the search for class pins and postage stamps. One
more pin was found and three rare stamps from
Brazil, and then the search was abandoned, and
they returned to Oak Hall, Dave carrying the
sailor's possessions.</p>

<p>That evening there was an interesting interview
in Doctor Clay's office, in which Dave and his
friends took an active part. The worthy master
of Oak Hall listened to all the boys had to tell with
keen attention, and smiled quietly when told how
Dave and Roger had first followed Shadow in his
somnambulistic feat. He took possession of the
class pins and the stamps, and said the latter were
undoubtedly from his collection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"We now have nearly all of the class pins," he
said. "But fully nine-tenths of the postage stamps
are still missing and they represent a value of at
least twenty-five hundred dollars. I am tolerably
sure that Maurice Hamilton took them in his sleep,
but the question is, did he destroy the others, or did
somebody else come along and take them?"</p>

<p>"I believe Chip Macklin came to see you, sir,"
said Dave, significantly.</p>

<p>"He did, Porter, and I am going to follow that
clew up&mdash;if it is a clew," answered Doctor Clay,
gravely.</p>

<p>After the others had departed, Dave showed the
things he had found belonging to Billy Dill. The
master of the Hall was as much astonished as anybody
over the resemblance between his pupil and
the photograph, and examined the picture with
care.</p>

<p>"I do not wonder that you wish to investigate
this," said he. "I should wish to do so, were I in
your position."</p>

<p>"I have simply got to do it, Doctor!" cried Dave.
"I shall not be able to settle my mind on a thing
until it's done. Would you go home and see Mr.
Wadsworth and Professor Potts first, or go direct
to that sailor?"</p>

<p>"Why not send a long letter to your friends,
telling them what you have told me? You can add
that I agree that the photograph resembles you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
closely, and that you wish to talk the matter over
once again with this William Dill."</p>

<p>As impatient as he was, Dave concluded to follow
this advice, and a letter of ten pages was sent
to Mr. Wadsworth and to Caspar Potts the next
morning. In the meantime, it may be added here,
Doctor Clay had a closer watch than ever set on
Shadow Hamilton's movements, and he also began
a quiet investigation of Gus Plum's doings.</p>

<p>The letter that Dave sent to Crumville created
a sensation in the Wadsworth household, and was
read and re-read several times by the members of
the manufacturer's family and by Professor Potts.</p>

<p>"There is undoubtedly something in this," said
the professor. "It certainly is entitled to a strict
investigation. If you will permit me, I will run up
to Oak Hall to see Dave, and then take him to see
this Billy Dill."</p>

<p>"I will go with you," answered the rich manufacturer.
"The outing will do us both good, and I
am greatly interested in Dave's welfare. I only
trust that there is a happy future in store for him."</p>

<p>"And I say the same, sir, for no boy deserves it
more," answered Professor Potts.</p>

<p>A telegram was sent to Dave, and on the following
day Oliver Wadsworth and Caspar Potts
journeyed to Oakdale. Dave met them at the
depot with the Hall carriage.</p>

<p>"There he is!" exclaimed old Caspar Potts, rush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>ing
up and shaking hands. "My boy! my boy! I
am glad to see you again!" And he fairly quivered
with emotion.</p>

<p>"And I am glad to see you," cried Dave, in return.
He shook hands with both men. "Mr.
Wadsworth, it was kind of you to answer my letter
so quickly," he added.</p>

<p>"I knew you would be anxious, Dave. My, how
well and strong you look! The air up here must do
you good."</p>

<p>"It is a very healthful spot," answered the
youth, "and I like it better than I can tell."</p>

<p>"A fine school&mdash;a fine school!" murmured Professor
Potts. "You could not go to a better."</p>

<p>On the way to the Hall, Dave told his story in
detail, and exhibited the photograph, which he had
brought with him, scarcely daring to leave it out
of his sight.</p>

<p>"It is just as you have said," remarked Oliver
Wadsworth. "A most remarkable resemblance,
truly!"</p>

<p>"That man must be some relative to Dave,"
added Caspar Potts. "There could not be such a
resemblance otherwise. It is undoubtedly the same
strain of blood. He may be a father, uncle, cousin,
elder brother&mdash;there is no telling what; but he is
a relative, I will stake my reputation on it."</p>

<p>The visitors were cordially greeted at Oak Hall
by Doctor Clay and made to feel perfectly at home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
They were given rooms for the night, and in the
morning the doctor and his visitors and Dave had
breakfast together.</p>

<p>It had been decided that a visit should be paid
to Billy Dill that very afternoon, and by nine
o'clock Mr. Wadsworth, Professor Potts, and
Dave were on the way to the town where was
located the sanitarium to which the sailor had been
taken. Dave had the tar's satchel and clothing
with him, and the precious photograph was stowed
away in his pocket. Just then he would not have
parted with that picture for all the money in the
world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>A GLEAM OF LIGHT</h3>


<p>"I would advise that you keep that satchel and
the picture out of sight at first," said Professor
Potts, as he rang the bell of the sanitarium. "Talk
to the old sailor and try to draw him out. Then
show him his belongings when you think the time
ripe."</p>

<p>Mr. Wadsworth and Dave thought this good
advice, and when they were ushered into the old
sailor's presence, the boy kept the satchel behind
him.</p>

<p>"Well, douse my toplights, but I'm glad to see
ye all!" cried Billy Dill, as he shook hands. "It's
kind o' you to pay a visit to such an old wreck as
I am."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're no wreck, Mr. Dill," answered
Oliver Wadsworth. "We'll soon have you as
right and tight as any craft afloat," he added, falling
into the tar's manner of speaking.</p>

<p>"Bless the day when I can float once more, sir.
Do you know, I've been thinkin' that a whiff o' salt
air would do me a sight o' good. Might fix my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
steerin' apparatus," and the tar tapped his forehead.</p>

<p>"Then you must have a trip to the ocean, by all
means," said Caspar Potts. He turned to the rich
manufacturer. "It might be easily arranged."</p>

<p>"Dill, I want to talk to you about the time you
were out in the South Seas," said Dave, who could
bear the suspense no longer. "Now, please follow
me closely, will you?"</p>

<p>"Will if I can, my hearty." The sailor's forehead
began to wrinkle. "You know my memory
box has got its cargo badly shifted."</p>

<p>"Don't you remember when you were down
there&mdash;at Cavasa Island, and elsewhere&mdash;how hard
times were, and how somebody helped you."</p>

<p>"Seems to me I do."</p>

<p>"Don't you remember traveling around with
your bundle and your satchel? You had some
money in bankbills and some loose silver, and a
work on navigation, and a Bible&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes! yes! I remember the Bible&mdash;it was the
one my aunt gave me&mdash;God bless her! She, Aunt
Lizzie&mdash;took care o' me when my mother died, an'
she told me to read it every day&mdash;an' I did, most
o' the time."</p>

<p>"Well, you had the Bible and your satchel and
your bundle of clothes," went on Dave, impressively.
"And at that time you fell in with a man
who afterwards gave you his photograph."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>"So I did&mdash;the man who looks like you. But
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute. Don't you remember his telling
you a story about a crazy nurse and a lost
child?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dave drew the photograph from his pocket and
thrust it forward, directly before the tar's eyes.</p>

<p>"There is the man!" he cried. "Now, what is
his name? Tell me his name, at once!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 406px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;Tell me his name, at once!&quot;&mdash;<i><a href="#Page_121">Page&nbsp;121</a>.</i></span>
</div>

<p>"Dunston Porter!" fairly shouted the sailor.
"Dunston Porter! That's it! I knew I would
remember it sometime! Dunston Porter, of course
it was! Funny how I forgot it. Better write it
down, afore it slips my cable again."</p>

<p>"Dunston Porter!" murmured Dave, and the
others likewise repeated the name.</p>

<p>"Ha! this is remarkable!" ejaculated Caspar
Potts. "Dave, do you remember what you called
yourself when you were first found and taken to
the poorhouse."</p>

<p>"I do, sir. I called myself Davy, and Porter,
and Dun-Dun."</p>

<p>"Exactly, and Dun-Dun meant Dunston. You
were trying to repeat the name, 'Dunston Porter'!"</p>

<p>"That would seem to be the fact," came from
Oliver Wadsworth. "And if so&mdash;&mdash;" He paused
significantly.</p>

<p>"You think my real name is Dunston Porter?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Either that, or else that is the name of some
relative of yours."</p>

<p>Dave's heart beat fast. He felt that he was
getting at least a faint glimpse of his past. He
turned again to Billy Dill.</p>

<p>"Then this Dunston Porter was your friend?"
he observed.</p>

<p>"He was, and he helped me when I was
stranded," was the answer. "I can't give ye all the
particulars, cos some o' 'em is more like a dream
than anything to me. When I try to think, my
head begins to swim," and the sailor wrinkled his
forehead as before and twitched his eyes.</p>

<p>"Tell me one thing," said the rich manufacturer,
"Do you think this Dunston Porter is still at Cavasa
Island, or in that locality?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so&mdash;I don't know."</p>

<p>"When did you come away from there?" asked
Professor Potts.</p>

<p>"It must be nigh on to a year ago. I came
straight to 'Frisco, went up the coast on a lumber
boat to Puget Sound, and then took passage to New
York. Next, I drifted up here to look up some
friends, and you know what happened after that."</p>

<p>"Was Dunston Porter alone out there?" questioned
Oliver Wadsworth.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;er&mdash;I can't say as to that. He didn't
say much about himself, that I can remember.
Once he told me about that child, but&mdash;but it's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
hazy&mdash;I can't think! Oh, it drives me crazy when
I try to think! The roar of the sea gets in my
ears, and the light from the lighthouse fires my
brain!" And the old tar began to pace the floor
in a rolling gait.</p>

<p>"He is growing excited!" whispered Caspar
Potts. "It is too bad! Were he in his right mind,
he might be able to tell us a great deal."</p>

<p>"Supposing we go out and have lunch together,"
suggested Oliver Wadsworth. "And then we can
go for a ride on the lake."</p>

<p>He spoke to the sanitarium manager, and the
upshot of the matter was that the whole party went
out to a hotel for dinner. Previous to going, Dave
gave Billy Dill the satchel and money and the
bundle, which seemed to tickle the tar immensely.</p>

<p>"Douse my toplight, but I feel like old times
again!" he cried, when they had had a good dinner
and were seated on the forward deck of one of the
lake boats, used to take out pleasure parties. "Oh,
but I love the water!"</p>

<p>"I suppose this doesn't look anything like around
Cavasa Island," remarked Dave, trying to draw the
sailor out.</p>

<p>"Not much, my boy. Cavasa Island has a volcano
in the middle of it, and once in a while that
volcano gets busy, and folks run for their lives.
An' they have earthquakes, too. Once I was out
with Dunston Porter, and along came an earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>quake,
and the other fellow, Mr. Lemington, almost
had his leg broken."</p>

<p>"Who was Mr. Lemington?" asked Caspar
Potts, quickly.</p>

<p>"Why, he was Dunston Porter's partner in the
treasure-hunting scheme. Oh, I didn't tell you
about that, did I? Funny, how it slipped my mind,
eh? They went to the volcano for the treasure.
I guess that was when the baby disappeared&mdash;and
that other man&mdash;I don't remember much of him,
he was wild. It was misty, misty. But they didn't
get any treasure, I know that. And then Mr.
Lemington got disgusted and sailed for Australia."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see the baby?" asked Dave.</p>

<p>"Did I? Why&mdash;I think so. I don't remember."</p>

<p>This was all they could get out of the sailor, try
their best, and, upon Oliver Wadsworth's advice,
they did not bother him any further. Before returning
to the sanitarium, the rich manufacturer
called Dave to one side.</p>

<p>"Dave, do you want to go to Cavasa Island?"
he asked, with a quiet smile.</p>

<p>"I do," was the prompt answer. "I was going
to speak to you about it. You know I told you
that Phil Lawrence is going&mdash;on one of his father's
ships this summer. I'd like very much to go with
Phil."</p>

<p>"Then you shall go, if we can make the necessary
arrangements. Now, what I want to know is: Do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
you not think it would be an excellent thing to take
this Billy Dill along? The trip might cure him
entirely, and he might aid you greatly in clearing
up this mystery."</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Wadsworth, you must have been
reading my thoughts!" exclaimed the country boy.
"I was going to suggest that very thing."</p>

<p>"Then we will speak to Dill about it before we
leave him. Do you know when your friend Lawrence
is to join his father's ship?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; but I can soon find out. And here is
Mr. Lawrence's address, if you want it," added
Dave, and wrote it on a card.</p>

<p>When the idea of sailing on the Pacific once more
was broached to Billy Dill, his eyes lit up with
pleasure.</p>

<p>"I'd like nothing better!" he cried. "I've been
a-thinkin' I might ship again. I can't stay an'
be spongin' on you folks any longer, it wouldn't be
proper. I want to pay up, now Dave has found
my money for me."</p>

<p>"Keep your money, Dill," returned Oliver
Wadsworth. "You may need it later." And then
he explained what Dave wished to do, and how the
tar might accompany the youth on his long trip.</p>

<p>"I'll go&mdash;an' glad o' the chance," said Billy Dill,
readily. "Just draw up your articles, an' I'll sign
'em any time ye want." And so the matter was
settled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Dave returned to Oak Hall late that night in a
very thoughtful mood. So much had been done
and said that he wanted time in which to think it
over. It was not until the next day that he got a
chance to talk matters over with Phil and Roger,
both of whom listened attentively to his tale.</p>

<p>"It seems to me you are learning something,
Dave," said Roger. "I hope the whole matter is
cleared up before long. Then Plum and Poole will
have to stop casting slurs on you."</p>

<p>"And now, Phil, I want to go out to the South
Seas with you," continued Dave. "And, what is
more, I am going to ask your father to find a place
on the vessel for Billy Dill."</p>

<p>"I fancy he'll do that, if I ask him," answered
Phil. "I'll write and tell the whole story, and I
know he will be as much interested as I am."</p>

<p>"I wish I was going on that trip with you," said
Roger. "Such an outing would suit me to a T."</p>

<p>"I guess there will be room enough for another
passenger," answered Phil. "Why don't you ask
your folks about it?"</p>

<p>"I will!" burst out the senator's son. "They
are going to Europe, you know. I was to go
along, but I'll see if I can't go with you two
instead."</p>

<p>After that there was a good deal of letter-writing,
and the boys waited anxiously for replies. In
the meanwhile, the final examinations for the term<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
began. Dave did his best to keep his mind on his
lessons, and succeeded so well that he came out
second from the top, studious Polly Vane heading
the list. Roger came next to Dave, with Ben Basswood
fourth, Phil sixth, and Sam Day seventh.
Gus Plum was almost at the end of the list, and
Nat Poole was but little better. In a lower class,
Luke Watson stood second, Buster Beggs fourth,
and Chip Macklin fifth. Shadow Hamilton, although
generally a good student, dropped to tenth
place in his class.</p>

<p>"I am more than gratified at this showing," said
Doctor Clay, when the examinations were over.
"The general average is higher than usual. You
have done well, and I shall award the prizes with
much pleasure."</p>

<p>After that there was an entertainment lasting
the best part of the afternoon, and in the evening
the students celebrated by a bonfire on the campus
and a general merrymaking. They sang the school
song over and over again, and gave the Hall cry:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"Baseball!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Football!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oak Hall<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Has the call!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Biff! Boom! Bang! Whoop!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"To-night's the night!" whispered Phil, as he
entered the school with his chums. "Just wait and
see!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>WINDING UP THE SCHOOL TERM</h3>


<p>"I must say, I don't feel much like fun to-night,"
observed Dave, as he hurried up the stairs to
dormitory No. 12. "I am anxious to get started
on that trip to the Pacific."</p>

<p>"Oh, that will hold for one day longer," said
Ben. "I wish I was going, too. Roger, have you
got word yet?"</p>

<p>"No, but I expect a letter to-morrow. If it
doesn't come, I'll have to wait till I get home."</p>

<p>Dave was in advance and was the first to throw
open the dormitory door. As he did so, a powerful
smell of onions greeted him.</p>

<p>"Great Cæsar!" he ejaculated. "Smells like an
onion factory up here. Somebody must have been
eating a dozen or two. Open the window, Phil,
while I make a light."</p>

<p>"Hello, what's this!" spluttered Ben, and fell
headlong over something. "A decayed cabbage!
Who put that on the floor?"</p>

<p>"Look out, everybody!" shouted Roger. "I just
stepped on something soft. Phew! Some decayed
sweet potatoes!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time Dave made a light, and all of the
boys who had come up gazed around the dormitory.
Then a cry of amazement and anger arose.</p>

<p>"This is a rough-house, and no mistake!"</p>

<p>"Somebody has been heaving decayed vegetables
all over the room!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and ancient eggs, too! This is an outrage!"</p>

<p>"Here is a rotten cabbage in my trunk!" called
out Roger. He held the object at arm's length.
"I'd like to soak the fellow who did it!" he added,
savagely.</p>

<p>With caution, all made an investigation. They
found their clothing and other belongings disarranged,
and decayed vegetables, stale eggs, and
sour milk were everywhere in evidence. It was a
mess bad enough to make them weep.</p>

<p>"We ought to report this," was Phil's comment.
"I don't mind real fun, but this is going too
far."</p>

<p>"This stuff must have come from the cellar," put
in Buster Beggs. "I heard the head cook telling
Pop Swingly that the place must be cleaned out,
or he would report it to the doctor. Swingly said
he didn't know the bad stuff was there."</p>

<p>"Well, Swingly didn't put the stuff here," put in
Dave. "It's the work of some of the other
fellows."</p>

<p>"I know where the janitor is!" cried Ben.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
"Shall I go down and question him? Maybe he
can give us a pointer."</p>

<p>"Yes, go ahead," said Dave.</p>

<p>"And I'll go along," added the senator's son,
and a moment later the two boys were off.</p>

<p>While the pair were gone, the others surveyed
the damage done. The most of the decayed vegetables
were swept into a corner, and then the boys
did what they could toward straightening out their
things.</p>

<p>"Here's a stale egg in my hat-box!" groaned
Sam. "I'd like to throw it at some fellow's head!"</p>

<p>Dave had found his trunk open, and was searching
the box with care. Suddenly he gave a loud
cry:</p>

<p>"It's gone! It's gone!"</p>

<p>"What's gone?" queried Phil.</p>

<p>"The photograph! I had it among my books
and papers, and the whole bunch is missing!"</p>

<p>"You mean the photo of the man who looks like
you?" asked Sam, quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes." Dave gave a groan that came straight
from his heart. "Oh, boys, I must get that back!
I can't afford to lose it! I must get it back! It is
worth more to me than anything in the world!"
He was so agitated that he could scarcely control
himself.</p>

<p>"Let us hunt for the picture," came from Buster
Beggs, who knew about the photograph, and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
started a search, which lasted until Ben and Roger
returned.</p>

<p>"We've discovered the chaps who are responsible,"
said Ben, in triumph.</p>

<p>"They are Gus Plum and Nat Poole," asserted
the senator's son. "Pop Swingly was throwing this
stuff away in a hole back of the campus, when Plum
and Poole came up. He heard them talking about
playing a trick, but he didn't think they'd lower
themselves by touching the mess. I suppose they
thought that they were doing something quite
smart."</p>

<p>"Dave's photo is gone," said Phil. "We have
been hunting for it everywhere."</p>

<p>"You don't say! Dave, that is too bad."</p>

<p>"We ought to make Plum and Poole clean up
this mess," came from Buster. "Let us try to
capture them."</p>

<p>The suggestion met with instant approval, and
the boys started to locate the bully and his crony.
Plum and Poole were still below, but Shadow Hamilton
announced that they were preparing to come
up by a side stairs.</p>

<p>"We must get them, sure!" cried Dave. "I
want that picture back, if nothing else."</p>

<p>Soon one boy, who was acting as a spy, announced
the coming of Plum and Poole. The pair
were allowed to reach the door of their dormitory,
when they were pounced on from behind and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
made prisoners. They tried to escape, but the
crowd was too many for them, and towels pulled
down over their mouths kept them from raising an
outcry.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of this?" spluttered Nat
Poole, when he found himself and his crony in
dormitory No. 12, and with the door closed and
locked.</p>

<p>"It means, in the first place, that I want my
things back," said Dave, "and especially a photograph
that was between my books."</p>

<p>"Humph! that photo is burned up," growled
Gus Plum.</p>

<p>"Gus Plum!" gasped Dave. He could say no
more.</p>

<p>"Plum, do you mean to say you burned that
picture up?" demanded Roger. "If you did, you
ought to be tarred and feathered for it!"</p>

<p>"He wouldn't dare to do it!" came boldly from
Phil. "If he did, I know what Dave will do&mdash;have
him sent to jail for it."</p>

<p>"Bah! You can't send me to jail for a little
fun," blustered the bully.</p>

<p>"That is no fun, Plum," put in Ben. "That
photo was of great importance. If you burned it
up, you will surely suffer."</p>

<p>"Is it really burned or not?" muttered Dave,
hoarsely. "Answer me, you&mdash;you cur!" and he
caught the bully by the throat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"Le-let go&mdash;don't strangle me! N-no&mdash;it's all
right. I was only fooling."</p>

<p>"Then, where is it?"</p>

<p>"In the&mdash;the closet&mdash;on the top shelf."</p>

<p>Dave dropped his hold and ran to the closet
pointed out. True enough, on the top shelf, in
a back corner, were the books, with the precious
photograph between them. Dave lost no time in
placing the picture in an inside pocket.</p>

<p>"You're a fine fellow, not to take a bit of fun
without getting mad," grumbled Gus Plum. He
did not dare to say too much in such a crowd.</p>

<p>"So you call this fun?" remarked Phil, sarcastically.
"Fun! to play the scavenger and bring this
stuff up here? Well, I must say, I don't like your
preference for a calling."</p>

<p>"Look here, you needn't call us scavengers!"
howled Nat Poole. "I am a gentleman, I am!"</p>

<p>"Well, you brought this up here, you and
Plum."</p>

<p>"It was only a&mdash;re&mdash;a joke. Everybody has
got to put up with jokes to-night."</p>

<p>"Well, you are going to put up with a little hard
work," came from Roger.</p>

<p>"Work?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You and Plum are going to clean up the
muss and put this room in apple-pie order."</p>

<p>"Huh! I see myself doing it!" stormed the
aristocratic youth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will do it," observed Ben. "Isn't that so,
fellows?"</p>

<p>There was a chorus of approvals.</p>

<p>"So take off your coats and get to work," said
Dave, who felt easier, now that he had the picture
back. "I guess you both need a little exercise."</p>

<p>"I'll be hanged if I do a stroke!" roared Gus
Plum.</p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken, when Ben caught up a
pitcher of ice-water and held it over the bully's
head.</p>

<p>"Take your choice, Plum!" he cried, and allowed
a little of the ice-water to trickle down the bully's
backbone. There was a roar of fright and a shiver.</p>

<p>"Oh! Don't do that! Do you want to freeze
me to death!"</p>

<p>"Now, Poole, maybe you want some," added
Ben, advancing. Poole tried to retreat, stumbled,
and sat down heavily on a decayed cabbage, which
squashed beneath him. He set up a roar.</p>

<p>"Now see what you've done, Ben Basswood!
My best gray suit, too! I'll fix you for this!"</p>

<p>"Both of you must get to work!" declared Dave.
"We'll give you two minutes in which to get
started. If you don't start&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll roll you in the decayed vegetables and
kick you out," finished Buster Beggs. With the
term so nearly ended, he was growing reckless.
"I'll play timekeeper," and he drew out his watch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Plum and Poole begged and protested, but all to
no purpose, and, badly scared, took off their coats
and cuffs, rolled up their sleeves, and began to clean
up the muss they had made. While this was under
way, the other boys of the dormitory came up and
viewed the scene with amazement and satisfaction.</p>

<p>At last the dirty job was at an end, at least so
far as Plum and Poole could go. They had worked
hard and were bathed in perspiration, and their
hands were in anything but a clean condition. Both
were "boiling mad," but neither dared to say a
word, for fear the others would make them do
more.</p>

<p>"Now you have learned your trade," said Phil,
finally, "you can graduate as full-fledged scavengers.
When you go out, don't fail to place that
bag of nasty stuff in a corner of your own room.
The smell will give you both pleasant dreams."</p>

<p>"Phil Lawrence&mdash;&mdash;" began the bully.</p>

<p>"Just wait till I&mdash;&mdash;" came from Nat Poole.</p>

<p>"Silence!" cried Dave. "Not a word, or you'll
be sorry. Take up the bag. Now, march!"</p>

<p>The door was flung open, and with the bag of
messy stuff between them, Plum and Poole marched
forth into the corridor and to the stairs leading to
the back yard. The boys of dormitory No. 12
watched them out of sight, then returned to their
room.</p>

<p>"I'll wager they are the maddest boys in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Hall," said Dave, when the door had been locked
once more.</p>

<p>"Will they come back, do you think?" questioned
Roger.</p>

<p>"I don't think so. But we can be on our guard."</p>

<p>They remained on guard for half an hour, but
Plum and Poole did not reappear. They had had
enough of their so-called fun, and they sneaked out
of sight at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>But, without this, there was fun galore that night
in the various dormitories. Two crowds of boys
held feasts, to which even the monitors were invited,
and dormitories Nos. 3 and 4 got into a
pillow fight, in the midst of which Job Haskers
appeared. The teacher was knocked over by a
pillow, and then some other pillows were piled on
top of him. After that he was hustled out of the
room, and, completely bewildered, he rolled down
the broad stairs, bumping on every step. Then
Pop Swingly came up, followed by "Horsehair,"
the carriage driver, to quell the disturbance, and
each received a pitcher of ice-water over his head,
which made both beat a hasty retreat. But by one
o'clock the school quieted down, and all of the
pupils went to sleep as if nothing out of the ordinary
had occurred.</p>

<p>The carryall belonging to the school was moving
away from the campus. It was loaded with
students and behind it came two wagons, full of
trunks and dress-suit cases. Back on the campus a
crowd was assembled to bid the departing ones
good-by.</p>

<p>"Write to me often!"</p>

<p>"Don't forget, Tom! Atlantic City, middle of
August!"</p>

<p>"Be sure and ask him to join the team!"</p>

<p>"Yes, we are going to Casco Bay. Come up, if
you can."</p>

<p>"Tell Jack&mdash;&mdash;Say, get off my toes, will you?
Tell Jack to come up to Lake Titus, back of
Malone. We'll give him a dandy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Toot! toot! toot!</i> Now then, Horsehair, start
'em up, and be lively, or I'll miss that connection
for Albany!"</p>

<p>"I'll start 'em up, all right, if you young gents
will give me a show," responded the driver. "Say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Buster, don't use the whip. Give me the reins,
Master Porter."</p>

<p>"Don't you want me to drive, Horsehair?"</p>

<p>"No, I want&mdash;&mdash;Say, you in the back, give
me my hat, will you?" shouted the driver, turning
around. "I ain't a-going a step till I git that hat!"</p>

<p>"All right, Horsehair, darling!" replied Sam
Day. "I thought I'd keep it to remember you by,
but if you want&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which puts me in mind of a story," said
Shadow Hamilton. He had caught the humor of
the occasion. "A lady once&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No stories allowed," broke in Phil.</p>

<p>"I can't tell a story unless I speak it aloud,"
answered Shadow, tartly.</p>

<p>"Phew, what a pun!" came from Roger. "Somebody
please dump him off for that."</p>

<p>"Hold tight, all of you!" called out the anxious
driver, and with a lurch the carryall made a turn
and started out of the academy grounds and along
the broad highway leading to Oakdale. All of the
boys shouted themselves hoarse, and horns and
rattles added to the din. Such a thing as holding
the students in was out of the question, and Doctor
Clay and his assistants did not attempt it. The
doctor and Andrew Dale smiled broadly and waved
their hands, and only Job Haskers looked bored.
The other teachers were busy in the building and
did not show themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the first load to leave, and another
was ready to depart directly after dinner. Nearly
all of the boys were in high spirits, and sang and
"cut up" all the way to the town, much to the
terror of Jackson Lemond, known only to the lads
as Horsehair, because he carried the signs of his
calling continually.</p>

<p>If there was one boy in the crowd particularly
sober at times, it was Shadow Hamilton. Doctor
Clay had communicated with his parents, and Mr.
Hamilton and the master of the school had had a
long conference regarding the pins and stamps that
had been taken. Shadow's father had agreed to
pay for the missing articles, if they could not be
recovered inside of the next few months. In the
meantime, a private detective was to be called in to
watch the movements of Gus Plum.</p>

<p>At Oakdale the party split into three parts, one
to go up the railroad line, another to go down, and
the third to take the connection for Albany. Phil,
Roger, Ben, and Dave took the same train, and
managed to get seats together.</p>

<p>"I wish I had heard from my folks," remarked
Roger. "But I think it is all right," he added,
hopefully.</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure, Roger," said Dave. "I
don't want you to be disappointed."</p>

<p>"I shall write to you as soon as I get home and
can talk to my father," said Phil to Dave. "We'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
be able to arrange everything without much trouble,
I am sure."</p>

<p>Near the end of their journey Dave and Ben
found themselves alone, Roger and Phil having
said good-by at places further up the road. As
they neared Crumville, the heart of the country
boy beat quicker. How many things had happened
since he had left that town to go to Oak Hall!</p>

<p>"I see the old white church steeple!" cried Ben,
as they came out of a patch of timber. "Looks
natural, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"I feel as if I had been away a year, instead of a
few months," answered Dave. He was peering
anxiously out of the window. "Here we come to
the station, and, yes, there is Mr. Wadsworth's
automobile, and Mr. Wadsworth himself and
Jessie!"</p>

<p>Soon the train came to a halt, and they piled out,
dress-suit cases in hand, and walked over to the
automobile.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" cried Jessie Wadsworth, a
beautiful miss of thirteen, with soft eyes and golden
curls. "I told papa you would be on this train."</p>

<p>"How do you do?" returned Dave, dropping his
suit case to lift his cap and shake hands. "I hope
you are well."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am," replied the miss, shaking back her
curls. "How do you do, Ben?" And then there
was more handshaking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Both of the boys were invited to enter the automobile,
and did so, and in a few minutes Ben found
himself at his own door. Then the machine was
turned toward the Wadsworth mansion.</p>

<p>"I like to go riding with papa," explained Jessie.
"I never go out with our man, though. Not since&mdash;you
know!" and she turned a pair of grateful
eyes upon Dave that made the boy color up.</p>

<p>"The machine appears to be perfectly safe, since
we have had it repaired," put in Mr. Wadsworth.
"But our man is better with the horses."</p>

<p>At the mansion Mrs. Wadsworth, an aristocratic
but motherly lady, came out to greet Dave,
followed by Caspar Potts, whose face was wreathed
in smiles. All told, it was a homecoming that
would have warmed the heart of any lad, and it
made Dave forget completely that he was a "poorhouse
nobody."</p>

<p>"You must tell me all about everything," said
Jessie, after a somewhat elaborate supper had been
served. "I don't want to miss a single thing!"</p>

<p>"Seems to me you are cutting out a big job for
Dave," laughed her father.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess I can tell all she'll wish to hear,"
answered the youth, and seated at one end of a
couch, with Jessie at the other, he told much of his
life at Oak Hall, with its studies, its pranks, and
its athletic sports. Dave could see the humorous
side of a thing as well as anybody, and some stories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
he told made Mr. and Mrs. Wadsworth laugh as
well as Jessie. On his trials he touched but lightly,
for he could not dream of giving his little lady
friend pain.</p>

<p>On the following day Nat Poole came home,
and Dave met the aristocratic youth in one of the
stores of Crumville. Poole gave him a glassy stare
and did not speak. A few minutes later Dave met
Ben.</p>

<p>"Just ran into Poole," said the latter, "and what
do you think, he made out that he didn't see me."</p>

<p>"He was in Parsons' store, but he wouldn't speak
to me, either," answered Dave. "He must feel
awfully sore. But I shan't mind."</p>

<p>"Nor I, Dave. I never did like that fellow, and
I don't like his father, either. By the way, have
you heard anything more about the farm that belongs
to Professor Potts?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I am glad, and so is he, that we didn't
let Nat's father get hold of it. The new trolley
company is going to put a line past it, and Mr.
Wadsworth says it will be quite valuable in time."</p>

<p>Two days passed, and then Dave got long letters
from Phil and Roger. Senator Morr had been to
see Mr. Lawrence and had arranged to have his
son go on the long trip to the South Seas. Roger
was almost wild with joy, and said he was going to
prepare for the trip immediately.</p>

<p>The letter from Phil told Dave that the start<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
for San Francisco was to be made on the following
Monday morning. All the boys were to meet at
the Grand Central Depot, in New York City, and
take the limited express which left for Chicago at
noon.</p>

<p>"I will go with you as far as New York," announced
Mr. Wadsworth. "I wish to see that your
journey is safely begun."</p>

<p>The last days of the week were busy ones for
Dave. A steamer trunk was procured for him, and
into this was packed his outfit, including a semi-nautical
suit that fitted him to perfection and gave
him quite a sailor look.</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll be a regular sailor by the time
you come back," said Jessie.</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," answered Dave. "I
am not going for that purpose," and his tone grew
serious.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know that, Dave. I hope you find what
you are going for. But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what, Jessie?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I&mdash;I don't want you to leave us, Dave. If
you find a father, or an uncle, or brother, or somebody
like that, I suppose you won't stay with us
any more." And the young miss pouted engagingly.</p>

<p>"I'll certainly not care to leave you, Jessie," he
answered, gently. "But you cannot blame me for
wanting to find out who I am, I am sure."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no, Dave!"</p>

<p>"I don't want to remain a nobody and have folks
shun me on that account."</p>

<p>"Who would do such a thing?" she asked, her
eyes opening widely.</p>

<p>"Oh, a good many folks."</p>

<p>"It is very mean of them," came from the little
miss, firmly. "But, never mind, Dave, I'll not shun
you," she went on, catching his hand and squeezing
it as hard as she could. "We're going to be just
like a brother and sister always, aren't we?"</p>

<p>"If you say so."</p>

<p>"Don't you say so, Dave?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Jessie."</p>

<p>"Then that is settled, and we won't talk about
it any more. Shun you! I just want to see them
do it! I won't speak to anybody that does such a
thing!" And Jessie looked as tragic as a miss of
thirteen can look.</p>

<p>Among the things provided by thoughtful Mr.
Wadsworth for Dave was a money belt, and in
this was placed a fair amount of bankbills, and also
a letter of credit.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wadsworth, you are more than kind!"
cried the country boy, and something like tears
stood in his honest eyes. "How can I ever repay
you?"</p>

<p>"In one way only, Dave. By making a real
man of yourself."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall do my best, sir."</p>

<p>"Then that is all I ask."</p>

<p>Billy Dill had been communicated with, and
Caspar Potts went after the tar and brought him
to Crumville, where Oliver Wadsworth procured
the sailor a new outfit. Billy Dill's health was now
restored completely, and the only thing he suffered
from was a slight loss of memory, and even that
defect seemed to be gradually wearing away.</p>

<p>"I'll be the happiest tar afloat when I have the
rolling ocean under me once more," said he to
Dave. "Cables an' capstans! but I do love the salt
breeze!"</p>

<p>"Well, you'll soon get enough of it," answered
the boy. "We have a long trip before us."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>THE TRIP TO THE FAR WEST</h3>


<p>"My stars! what a very busy place!"</p>

<p>This was Dave's exclamation as he and Oliver
Wadsworth hurried along one of the streets of
New York City, on the way to buy some small
thing which had been forgotten. They had arrived
in the metropolis an hour ahead of time, and the
country boy had stared at the many sights in
wonder.</p>

<p>"It is one of the busiest cities in the world,"
answered the manufacturer, with a smile. "A
fortune can be made or lost here in no time."</p>

<p>"I believe you. And the people! Why, there
is a regular crowd, no matter where you turn."</p>

<p>"Don't you think you'd like the city, Dave?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;perhaps I should, after I got
used to it."</p>

<p>Roger and Phil had not yet come in, and they
had left Billy Dill at the depot to watch out for
them. On returning to the station, Dave and Mr.
Wadsworth met the three at the doors.</p>

<p>"Here we are again!" cried Roger, shaking
hands. "And not very much time to spare, either."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is the train in?" asked the manufacturer.</p>

<p>"Will be in a few minutes, so the gateman said,"
answered Phil.</p>

<p>They saw to it that their trunks were properly
cared for, and a short while after the cars came in
and they climbed aboard. Seats had been engaged
beforehand, so there was no trouble on that score.</p>

<p>"Now remember to write whenever you get the
chance," said Oliver Wadsworth to Dave. "And
if you run short of funds, don't hesitate to let me
know."</p>

<p>"I'll remember, and thank you very much," replied
Dave, and then the long train moved off,
slowly at first, and then at a good rate of speed.
Dave's long journey to solve the mystery of his
identity had begun.</p>

<p>"Say, what mountain is this we're goin' under,
anyway?" came presently from the sailor. "I
noticed it when I came to New York."</p>

<p>"This isn't a mountain," laughed Roger. "It
is New York City itself. We are under the streets."</p>

<p>"Great whales! Wonder they don't knock down
the wall o' somebuddy's cellar!"</p>

<p>It was not long before they came out into the
open, and then both Dave and the sailor looked out
of the windows with interest. Phil and Roger
were more used to traveling, and spent the time in
pointing out objects of interest and in answering
questions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>The fine coach was a revelation to Billy Dill,
who, in the past, had traveled exclusively in the
ordinary day cars.</p>

<p>"These here seats are better nor them in a barber
shop," he observed. "An' thet little smoking-room
is the handiest I ever see. But, boys, we made one
big mistake," he added, suddenly.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Phil.</p>

<p>"Unless we tie up to an eatin' house on the way,
we'll be starved. Nobody brung any grub along."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that," said Roger, with a
wink at the others. "I think I can scrape up some
crackers and cheese somewhere."</p>

<p>"Well, that's better&mdash;although I allow as how
we could have brought some ham sandwiches as
well as not."</p>

<p>They had all had dinner, so nobody was hungry
until about six o'clock, when a waiter from the
dining-car came through in his white apron.</p>

<p>"First call to supper!"</p>

<p>"Wot's thet?" queried Billy Dill.</p>

<p>"Come and see," answered Dave, and led the
way to the dining-car. When the old sailor saw
the tables, and saw some folks eating as if at home,
he stared in amazement.</p>

<p>"Well, keelhaul me, if this don't beat the
Dutch!" he ejaculated, dropping into a chair
pointed out to him. "Reg'lar hotel dinin'-room on
wheels, ain't it? Never heard o' such a thing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
my life, never! Say, Roger, better keep that
crackers an' cheese out o' sight, or they'll laugh at
ye!" he added, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"You never saw anything like this, then?" asked
Dave.</p>

<p>"Never. I allers traveled in one o' them, plain,
every-day kind o' trains, an' took my grub along
in a pasteboard box."</p>

<p>Though amazed, Billy Dill was not slow about
eating what was set before him, and he declared
the repast the finest he had ever tasted. After the
meal he went into the smoking compartment for
a smoke, and then came back to the boys.</p>

<p>"Feelin' a bit sleepy," he announced. "I suppose
there ain't no objections to my going to
sleep."</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Phil. "Do you want your
berth made up right away?"</p>

<p>"Humph! that's a good one!" laughed the tar.
"They may have an eatin' room, but they ain't got
no bedrooms, an' I know it. I'll do my best in the
seat, though I allow a reg'lar long sofy would be
better."</p>

<p>"Just you wait until I call the porter," said
Roger, and touched the push-button. "This gentleman
will have his berth made up," he went on,
as the porter appeared.</p>

<p>"Yes, sah."</p>

<p>"Make it up with real sheets, messmate," put in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Billy Dill, thinking it was a joke. "An' you might
add a real feather piller, while ye are at it."</p>

<p>"Yes, sah," answered the porter, with a grin.
"Please step to another seat, sah."</p>

<p>"Come," said Dave, and arose and took Billy
Dill to the opposite side of the sleeping-coach.</p>

<p>The old tar dropped into a vacant seat and
watched the porter as he began to make up the
berths. From a smile his face changed to a look of
wonder, and when he saw the clean sheets, blankets,
and pillows brought forth he could scarcely control
himself.</p>

<p>"Cables, capstans, an' codfish!" he murmured.
"Thet beats the dinin'-room, don't it? Say, maybe
they hev got a ballroom on board, an' a church, an'
a&mdash;a&mdash;farm, an' a few more things."</p>

<p>"Not quite," answered Roger, with a laugh.
"But there is a library, if you want any books to
read."</p>

<p>"Beats all! Why, this here train is equipped like
a regular ship, ain't she?"</p>

<p>"Almost," said Dave. "Here are two berths;
you can take one and I'll take the other."</p>

<p>"Good enough, Dave. Which will ye have?"</p>

<p>The boy said he preferred the lower berth, and
Billy Dill swung himself up in true sailor fashion
to that above.</p>

<p>"Makes me think o' a ship!" he declared. "I
know I'll sleep like a rock!" And half an hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
later he was in the land of dreams, and then the
boys also retired.</p>

<p>Morning found them well on their way to Chicago,
and just before noon they rolled into the great
city by the lakes. Here they had two hours to
wait, and spent the time in getting dinner and taking
a short ride around to see the sights.</p>

<p>"This is as far west as I have been," said Roger.
"The rest of the journey will be new to me."</p>

<p>"I once took a journey to Los Angeles," said
Phil. "But I went and returned by the southern
route, so this is new to me also."</p>

<p>"I have never traveled anywhere&mdash;that is, since
I can remember," put in Dave. "But I am sure I
am going to like it&mdash;that is, if I don't get seasick
when I am on the ocean."</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose we'll all get our dose of that,"
responded the senator's son.</p>

<p>"Maybe not," said Billy Dill. "Some gits it, an'
some don't."</p>

<p>Nightfall found them well on the second portion
of their journey to San Francisco. There was an
observation car on the train, and the whole party
spent hours seated on camp-chairs, viewing scenery
as it rushed past them. Now and then, for a
change, they would read, and Billy Dill would
smoke, and the boys often talked over what was
before them.</p>

<p>"My father said I might tell you the object of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
my trip," said Phil to his chums. "But he does not
want anybody else to know of it, unless it becomes
necessary for me to say something to the captain.
The supercargo of the ship is a man named Jasper
Van Blott. He has worked for my father for
some years, and my father always thought him
honest. But lately things have happened which
have caused my father to suspect this supercargo.
He sometimes disposes of certain portions of a
cargo, and his returns are not what they should be."</p>

<p>"Then you are to act as a sort of spy," said
Roger.</p>

<p>"I am to watch everything he does without letting
him know exactly what I am doing. And
when he makes a deal of any kind, I am to do my
best to ascertain if his returns are correct. If I
find he is honest, my father is going to retain him
and increase his salary; if he is dishonest, my father
will discharge him, and possibly prosecute him."</p>

<p>"Have you ever met this Van Blott?" asked
Dave.</p>

<p>"Once, when he called on my father two years
ago. He is a smooth talker, but I did not fancy his
general style. He is supposed to be a first-class
business man, and that is why my father has retained
him. I do not believe Captain Marshall
likes him much, by the way he writes to father."</p>

<p>"Have you ever met Captain Marshall?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, twice. You'll like him, I know, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
is so bluff and hearty. My father has known him
for many years, and he thinks the captain one of
the best skippers afloat. He has sailed the Pacific
for ten years and never suffered a serious accident."</p>

<p>"In that case, we'll be pretty safe in sailing under
him," observed Roger. "It will certainly be a
long trip&mdash;four thousand miles, or more!"</p>

<p>"Do you know anybody else on the ship?" asked
Dave.</p>

<p>"I do not, and I don't know much about the ship
herself, excepting that she is named the <i>Stormy
Petrel</i>. Father bought her about a year ago. She
is said to be a very swift bark, and yet she has great
carrying capacity."</p>

<p>"Will you please explain to me just what a bark
is?" said Roger. "I must confess I am rather
dumb on nautical matters."</p>

<p>"A bark is a vessel with three masts. The front
mast, or foremast, as sailors call it, and the main,
or middle, mast are rigged as a ship, that is, with
regular yardarms and sails. The back mast, called
the mizzen mast, is rigged schooner fashion, that
is, with a swinging boom."</p>

<p>"That's plain enough. Hurrah for the <i>Stormy
Petrel</i>! Dave, we'll be full-fledged sailors before
we know it."</p>

<p>"We must get Billy Dill to teach us a thing or
two before we go aboard," said the country boy.
"Then we won't appear so green."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>This all thought good advice, and for the remainder
of the journey they frequently talked nautical
matters over with the old tar. Billy Dill had
his book on navigation with him, and also a general
work on seamanship, and he explained to them
how a ship, and especially a bark, was constructed,
and taught them the names of the ropes and sails,
and many other things.</p>

<p>"You'll soon get the swing on it," he declared.
"It ain't so much to learn fer a feller as is bright
an' willin' to learn. It's only the blockheads as
can't master it. But I allow as how none o' you
expect to work afore the mast, do ye?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly," answered Phil. "But there is no
harm in learning to do a sailor's work, in case we
are ever called on to take hold. Somebody might
get sick, you know."</p>

<p>"Thet's true, lad&mdash;an' I can tell ye one thing:
A ship in a storm on the Pacific, an' short-handed,
ain't no plaything to deal with," concluded the old
tar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>SAILING OF THE "STORMY PETREL"</h3>


<p>As soon as the party arrived at San Francisco,
Phil set out to learn if the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> was in
port. This was easy, for the firm of which Mr.
Lawrence was the head had a regular shipping
office near the docks.</p>

<p>"Yes, she is in and almost loaded," said the
clerk at the office, as soon as he learned Phil's
identity. "I'll take you down to her, if you wish."</p>

<p>"Very well," answered the youth, and soon he
and his chums and Billy Dill were on board of the
bark. A gang of stevedores were on hand, bringing
aboard boxes, crates, and barrels, and in the
midst of the crowd were Captain Frank Marshall
and Van Blott, the supercargo, both directing
operations.</p>

<p>"Well! well!" ejaculated the captain, on catching
sight of Phil. "Got here at last, eh? Glad to
see you. So these are the young gentlemen to go
along? Well, I reckon you'll find the trip long
enough. Glad to know you, Porter, and the same
to you, Morr. Yes, we are mighty busy just now.
Got a little of the cargo in the wrong way&mdash;tell you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
about it later"&mdash;the last words to Phil. "I shall be
glad of your company. Go down into the cabin
and make yourselves at home, and I'll be with you
presently."</p>

<p>"Thank you," answered Phil. "But is that Mr.
Van Blott over yonder?"</p>

<p>"It is. Want to see him? Trot along, if you
do." And the captain turned to his work once
more.</p>

<p>By his general manner Captain Marshall showed
that he did not wish to come into contact with the
supercargo just then, and Phil walked over to that
personage alone. The supercargo was a tall, thin
individual with a sallow face and a thin, yellowish
mustache.</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Van Blott, I believe," said Phil.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the short and crusty answer, and the
supercargo gave the boy a sharp look.</p>

<p>"I am Phil Lawrence. I guess you do not remember
me?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried the supercargo, and his manner
changed instantly. "How do you do? I didn't
think you'd be here quite so soon. I hope your
father is well?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Then you got his letter, Mr. Van
Blott?"</p>

<p>"Yes, this morning. I haven't read it very carefully
yet. He said something about you helping
me, if I needed help. Well, I won't bother you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
much. I have done the work alone in the past, and
I can do it now."</p>

<p>"I am willing to do all I can to assist you,"
said Phil, politely.</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it. But I won't trouble you&mdash;so
you and your friends can just lie back and enjoy
yourselves," returned Jasper Van Blott, smoothly.
"No use in working, when you are on a vacation."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shan't call it work. I want to learn a
little about the business. Some day, you know, I
am to go into my father's office."</p>

<p>At this a slight frown crossed the supercargo's
face, but he quickly smiled it off. "As you please,"
he said. "But excuse me now, I'm very busy. We
are trying to get ready to sail to-morrow by noon,
and there is still a great deal to do."</p>

<p>In some way Phil felt himself dismissed, and he
rejoined Dave and Roger, who were standing by
the companionway. All went below, to find the
cabin of the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> deserted.</p>

<p>"This is a fine cabin," remarked Dave, gazing
around. "It's as cozy as can be."</p>

<p>"Where is Billy Dill?" asked Phil.</p>

<p>"He said he'd go forward and await orders."</p>

<p>"Did he say anything about the vessel?"</p>

<p>"Said she looked to be a first-class sailer and in
prime condition," answered the senator's son. "He
was delighted with her."</p>

<p>"What do you think of the captain?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think I shall like him," returned Dave.
"Roger thinks the same."</p>

<p>"I don't like that supercargo," went on Phil,
lowering his voice. "I am afraid I shall have
trouble with him before the trip is over. He
doesn't want me to know a thing about what he is
doing."</p>

<p>A little later Captain Marshall came in and
showed them the staterooms they were to occupy&mdash;one
fair-sized one for Dave and Roger and a
smaller one adjoining for Phil. Then he introduced
the boys to his first mate, Paul Shepley, and
to several others. When he got Phil by himself
he asked the youth if the supercargo had said anything
about the loading of the bark.</p>

<p>"Not a word," answered Phil. "Why do you
ask that question?"</p>

<p>"We had some trouble just before you came on
board. Mr. Van Blott wanted some things done
one way and I wanted them another. He thinks
he can run things, but I am going to let him understand
that I am master here. I tell you this, because
I want you to understand how matters are
going."</p>

<p>"From what you say, I don't think you like Mr.
Van Blott," said Phil. "If so, let me say, I don't
think I shall like him myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can get along with him, if he will mind
his own business and do what is right," answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the captain of the <i>Stormy Petrel</i>. "But he must not
attempt to dictate to me, even if he is the supercargo."</p>

<p>"Well, I trust we have no trouble," answered
Phil, with a sigh. But the trouble, he felt, was
already in the air.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon their baggage came on
board, and the boys set to work to establish themselves
on the ship which was to be their home for
so many weeks to come. In the meantime Billy
Dill reported to the captain, and was assigned to
his place in the forecastle as an extra hand at full
pay. The old tar was pleased mightily, and the
smell of oakum and bilge water appeared to act on
him like a tonic. He was one to make friends
readily, and soon established himself as a favorite
among the foremast hands.</p>

<p>In the morning the boys took a final run ashore,
purchasing a few things they thought they needed
and mailing some long letters home. Coming back
to the bark, they caught sight of the supercargo
coming, with another man, from a drinking place
on a corner.</p>

<p>"Humph! that shows he drinks," muttered Phil.</p>

<p>"I think most seafaring men do," answered
Roger.</p>

<p>"Captain Marshall does not."</p>

<p>They had to pass the supercargo, who stood on
the corner with his back to them, talking to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
other man. Just as they went by, they heard Van
Blott remark:</p>

<p>"Don't worry; this trip is going to pay me big,
Bangor, and when I come back you shall have all
that is coming to you." This was all the three boys
heard, but it set Phil to thinking.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know how this trip is going to pay
him big," said the shipowner's son. "Father says
he gets his regular salary and a small commission."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has some private deal he wishes to
put through," suggested Dave.</p>

<p>"No; by his agreement he has no right to do any
outside work. His time belongs exclusively to the
<i>Stormy Petrel</i> and her cargo."</p>

<p>They returned to the bark, and quarter of an
hour later the supercargo followed, with a flushed
face that showed he had been imbibing more liquor
than was good for him.</p>

<p>"Are you ready to sail?" demanded Captain
Marshall, striding up.</p>

<p>"All ready," was the surly response, and the
supercargo walked down to his stateroom and disappeared.</p>

<p>Orders were given to cast off, and in a very few
minutes the bark was on her way from San Francisco
Bay toward the Golden Gate. It was a perfect
day, and by nightfall the harbor was left
behind and land became a mere speck in the distance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>The first night on the bark passed pleasantly
enough for the three chums. At first the quarters
on the vessel appeared small to them, but they soon
grew accustomed to the change. All slept soundly
and they were out on deck very shortly after
sunrise.</p>

<p>"Well, how do you like life on <i>Mother Carey's
Chicken</i>?" asked Phil, when they were gazing at
the rolling ocean.</p>

<p>"<i>Mother Carey's Chicken</i>?" repeated Dave,
with a puzzled look.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know what he means!" cried Roger, with
a laugh. "A stormy petrel is a bird that the sailors
call a Mother Carey's chicken."</p>

<p>"What a name! I think I like <i>Stormy Petrel</i>
better," observed Dave. "But, I say, isn't this just
grand! A fellow can open his lungs and drink in
ozone by the barrel!"</p>

<p>"And hardly a cloud in the sky," added Roger.
"If this is any criterion, we'll have the finest kind
of a trip."</p>

<p>"Well, boys, I see you are up on time," came
from a little behind them, and now Captain Marshall
strode up. "Fine sea this, and a fine breeze,
too."</p>

<p>"How long will this nice weather last?" asked
Roger.</p>

<p>"Humph!" The captain humped his shoulders.
"No man alive can tell that. A few days, at least,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
maybe a week or more. But, sooner or later, we'll
pay up for it. The finer the weather, the bigger
the storm to follow."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't mind an ordinary storm," observed
Dave. "But I don't want to be wrecked."</p>

<p>"No danger of that, lad. The <i>Stormy Petrel</i>
can outride any storm likely to blow in these parts.
She is one of the best vessels I ever sailed in&mdash;a
man couldn't ask for a better."</p>

<p>"How much of a crew have you, Captain Marshall?"
asked Phil.</p>

<p>"I have sixteen men, all told, besides the tar you
brought along." The brow of the shipmaster
wrinkled slightly. "They are all pretty fair men,
too, excepting four, and those four Mr. Van Blott
brought in."</p>

<p>"What's the trouble with the four?"</p>

<p>"They drink, and they don't mind as they
should." Captain Marshall turned to Phil. "After
breakfast, I'd like to talk to you on business in
the cabin," he added.</p>

<p>This was a hint that Dave and Roger were not
desired, and, accordingly, after the meal they left
Phil and the captain alone.</p>

<p>"I've been studying your father's instructions to
me," said Captain Marshall to Phil. "As I view
it, you are to be a sort of assistant to Mr. Van
Blott."</p>

<p>"If he will allow it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"And if he won't?" The captain gazed at Phil
sharply.</p>

<p>"Then, perhaps, I'll do something on my own
account."</p>

<p>"Are you going to keep your eye on him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but you need not tell him so."</p>

<p>"Don't worry&mdash;I shan't open my mouth, Philip.
I am glad to hear of this, for, I tell you privately,
Van Blott needs watching. He is a sly dog, and I
am satisfied in my own mind that he has something
up his sleeve."</p>

<p>"Do you know a man named Bangor in San
Francisco? He was with Mr. Van Blott just
before we sailed."</p>

<p>"Ah! I thought so! Yes, I know him, and his
reputation among shippers is none of the best. He
used to be a supercargo for the Donaldson-Munroe
Company, but they discharged him for some
crooked work. What were he and Van Blott
doing?"</p>

<p>Phil told of what he had overheard.</p>

<p>"That confirms my idea exactly!" cried the captain
of the <i>Stormy Petrel</i>. "There is something in
the wind. You must watch out, by all means, and
I'll do the same. This man must not be allowed
to do anything wrong, if we can possibly prevent
it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>DAYS ON THE OCEAN</h3>


<p>The weather remained fine for a full week, and
with favoring winds the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> bowled
along merrily on her course. The ocean rolled
lazily in the warm sunshine, a few birds circled
about the ship, and once they passed a steamer coming
from the Hawaiian Islands, and a schooner
from Manila, and that was all.</p>

<p>"Shall we stop at Honolulu?" asked Roger, of
the captain.</p>

<p>"No. I thought of doing so at first, but now I
shall make no stops until we get to Christmas
Island, and from there we will go direct to Cavasa
and then to Sobago. What we do after that will
depend largely on what is done about a cargo."</p>

<p>So far none of the boys had experienced any seasickness,
and they congratulated themselves on their
escape, but Billy Dill put a little damper on their
ardor.</p>

<p>"This ain't no weather to judge by," was his
comment. "Wait till we get some cross-winds and
the ships starts to roll. Maybe then ye won't be
so settled in the stomach."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>The few days on the ocean had done the old tar
a world of good. His eyes were brighter and he
was physically in the best of health once more. His
mind, too, was clearer, and one day he announced to
Dave that he had something to tell.</p>

<p>"I ain't quite sure as I have the exact straight
on 't," he began. "A little on 't is still like a
dream. But I know enough to make a putty
straight story," and then he told his tale.</p>

<p>A good portion of it was not unlike the story
of many sailors. When very young, he had had a
strong desire to go to sea, and at his first opportunity
had shipped as a cabin boy. From cabin boy
he had become a foremast hand, and had been in
such service more years than he could count. He
had visited nearly every portion of the globe, and
had been wrecked twice, once off the coast of
Africa and once while trying to round Cape Horn.</p>

<p>Three years before had found him at Sydney,
Australia, looking for a chance to ship. While
down among the wharves, he had discovered a
tramp vessel, the <i>Mary Sacord</i>, bound for Cavasa
and other islands in the South Seas, and had signed
articles for a year's cruise. The captain proved
to be a brute, and there was fighting on the vessel
from the time she left Sydney until Cavasa was
reached. There, at the main seaport, Billy Dill
went ashore and refused to go aboard again.</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Mary Sacord</i> was very angry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
over the refusal of the seaman to continue on the
trip, and threatened Dill with imprisonment, and
even had the old tar arrested. But, at this juncture,
two men came forward and aided the sailor in his
trouble, and, as a consequence, Billy Dill was set
free and the vessel went on her way without him.</p>

<p>One of the men who had helped Billy Dill was
Dunston Porter and the other was Samuel Lemington.
They were both Americans and fairly well-to-do.
At first, they did not tell the old sailor much
about their business, but they asked him if he
wished to work for them, and he said he was willing,
and they offered him thirty dollars a month
and all his expenses.</p>

<p>The two Americans, so the tar discovered later,
were after a treasure of precious stones, said upon
good authority to have been hidden years before
in the mountains by a former cannibal king of
Cavasa and some other South Sea islands. The
three journeyed into the interior of the island and
spent months in looking for the treasure, but without
success. Then came an earthquake and the
volcano in the center of the island began to grow
active, and all three had to flee to the coast in order
to escape destruction.</p>

<p>It was on this treasure hunt that Billy Dill heard,
through Dunston Porter, about the lost child that
had been carried off by a nurse who was not mentally
sound, although usually good-hearted. Dun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>ston
Porter had not said very much about the matter,
for it seemed to hurt him a great deal&mdash;so
much, in fact, that the old sailor did not think it
best to ask for the particulars. But he knew one
thing, that, try his best, Dunston Porter could not
learn what had become of the woman and the little
one, and he was half inclined to believe that both
were dead.</p>

<p>"Well, did he say that the child was his son?"
asked Dave, with deep interest.</p>

<p>"No, it was some relative of his, I think. I don't
believe Dunston Porter was married."</p>

<p>"When you came back to the coast, what did this
Mr. Porter do?"</p>

<p>"He and Mr. Lemington stayed in the town,
trying to make up their minds as to what they'd do
next. I got a chance to ship, and, as they didn't
seem to want me any more, I sailed away, and then
I did as I've told you before."</p>

<p>This was practically all the information Billy
Dill could give concerning Dunston Porter and the
missing child, although he told much more concerning
the treasure hunt, and of several fights with
the natives of the interior. He said the natives
were a bad lot, and he wanted no more to do with
them than was absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>"How old should you judge this Dunston Porter
to be?" asked Dave.</p>

<p>"Forty to forty-five years old, my lad."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did he ever tell you where he came from?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly. But he was an American, and he
knew a good bit about San Francisco, Chicago, and
New York, and I remember he once told about
hunting in the Maine woods and in the Adirondacks."</p>

<p>"He didn't say a word about coming back to the
United States?"</p>

<p>"Not that I can remember."</p>

<p>With this information Dave had to be content.
The story had been a strain on Billy Dill, and afterward
he complained of a headache and of feeling
dizzy. But a good night's rest restored him
completely.</p>

<p>The sailor was at all times delighted to instruct
the boys in the art of seamanship, and under his
tutelage they learned rapidly, so that any of them
could go aloft and make or take in sail whenever
required. He also taught them how to make knots
of various kinds, and many other things useful on
board a ship. In the meantime Captain Marshall
allowed them to read his works on navigation, and
gave them a few lessons in steering, and in the
use of the compass, sextant, and other nautical
instruments.</p>

<p>"We'll be full-fledged sailors before this voyage
is over," remarked Roger to his chums. "I declare,
I almost feel as if I could handle a small
ship already."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Maybe you could, on the Leming River," rejoined
Phil. "But when it came to a big storm on
the Pacific, I rather believe you'd find it a different
story."</p>

<p>So far, Phil had had but little to do with the
supercargo, but now he asked the man if he could
look over the books. Jasper Van Blott agreed, but
the scowl on his face showed plainly that the move
was not to his liking. Phil went over the accounts
at his leisure, but could find nothing wrong in them.
There were a few entries that looked odd, but the
supercargo was ready with explanations concerning
them.</p>

<p>"Well, have you found anything wrong?" questioned
Dave, after Phil had spent three days over
the books.</p>

<p>"Nothing much, Dave," was the answer from
the shipowner's son.</p>

<p>"The supercargo isn't very friendly, I notice."</p>

<p>"Oh, he hates it, that I am going on this trip,"
answered Phil.</p>

<p>There seemed to be but one man on the ship
with whom the supercargo was thoroughly friendly,
and that was Paul Shepley, the first mate. The
pair were together a large part of the time, and
their conversation was frequently an animated one.</p>

<p>"I can't get it out of my head that those two are
working together over something," said Dave.
"Why, they are as thick as bees in a sugar barrel."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've noticed that, too," came from Roger.
"Perhaps they are hatching up some mischief."</p>

<p>On the following day the weather became more
unsettled, and occasionally the clouds showed themselves
above the horizon. Captain Marshall gave
orders to his mate that a strict watch should be kept
for a blow.</p>

<p>"I guess we are in for it, now!" cried Dave, that
afternoon. "It is much rougher than it has yet
been."</p>

<p>"I know I am in for it," answered Roger. His
face was white, and wore a troubled look.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, seasick?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I fancy so. My head spins like a top and
my stomach is starting to do the same."</p>

<p>"Better go below, lad," said Captain Marshall,
coming up. "It won't do you any good to remain
on deck."</p>

<p>Roger shuffled off to the companionway, and
Dave went after him. The senator's son was
growing worse every minute, and it was not long
before Phil announced that he also felt sick. Both
went to their staterooms, and Dave did what he
could to relieve their distress.</p>

<p>"If the old tub would only stop for a minute&mdash;just
one minute!" groaned Roger.</p>

<p>"That's what I say," responded Phil. "Oh,
dear! I'd give a hundred dollars to be on shore
again!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think I'd make it a thousand," groaned the
senator's son. "Why, Dave, don't you feel it at
all?"</p>

<p>"Well, I feel a little strange," answered the
country boy, but he did not add that it was because
he had to stand by and assist his friends. He made
them as comfortable as possible, and then rushed
to the deck, to get some fresh air and to get the
matter off his mind.</p>

<p>A storm was certainly brewing, and Dave wondered
how soon it would strike the <i>Stormy Petrel</i>
and how long it would last. The black clouds were
piling up in the sky and the wind came in unsteady
puffs. Below, the clear, blue water had turned to
a dark green.</p>

<p>The first mate was in charge of the deck and, so
far, he had given no orders to shorten sail. Ever
and anon a sail would crack in the wind and the
bark would give a plunge in the sea. Dave walked
forward to where Billy Dill stood by the rail,
watching the sky anxiously.</p>

<p>"This looks stormy, doesn't it?" questioned the
youth.</p>

<p>"Stormy? Great dogfish! I should allow as
how it did, lad. We're in for a blow, an' a big one,
too."</p>

<p>"Then isn't it about time to take in sail?"</p>

<p>"I should say it was."</p>

<p>"Then why doesn't the mate do so?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>At this question the old tar shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Reckon he wants to take the benefit o' all the
breeze he can," he answered. "But it ain't the best
thing to do&mdash;not to my way o' reasonin'. If he
ain't keerful, we may lose a topmast, or more."</p>

<p>"I suppose you don't dare to say anything to
him?"</p>

<p>"No. He's in charge, an' thet's all there is
to it."</p>

<p>The storm continued to approach, and now
several of the sailors looked anxiously at the first
mate. He was evidently in a savage mood, and
paid no attention to them.</p>

<p>"Unless he does sumthin' soon, we'll lose a stick,
sure," said Billy Dill to Dave, in a low tone. "I
never saw sech a contrary mate in my life!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I had better speak to Captain Marshall,"
suggested the country youth.</p>

<p>"I wish ye would&mdash;it would be safer. But don't
let Shepley know it&mdash;or he'll be as mad as a hornet
at ye," added the old tar.</p>

<p>Leaving the bow, Dave hurried to the stern and
toward the companionway. Here he almost ran
headlong into the first mate.</p>

<p>"Hi! look where you are going!" ejaculated the
man, roughly. "Have you no manners?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me," returned Dave. "Don't you think
we are having a pretty big blow, sir?" he added.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, this won't amount to much," grumbled
Paul Shepley. "Nothing to get scared about."</p>

<p>Dave said nothing to this. He hurried below,
and a moment later stood in front of Captain
Marshall's stateroom door. The master of the
<i>Stormy Petrel</i> was taking a nap, but at the boy's
knock roused up instantly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>CAUGHT IN A STORM</h3>


<p>"Who is there?"</p>

<p>"Captain Marshall, can I speak to you a
moment?"</p>

<p>"Oh, so it is you, Porter! What do you want?"</p>

<p>"There seems to be a big storm coming up, and
I thought I had better tell you about it."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;er&mdash;isn't Mr. Shepley on deck?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;but I thought I had better tell you,
anyway," went on Dave.</p>

<p>"Mr. Shepley knows what to do," answered the
captain, rather shortly. He did not fancy having
his much-needed nap disturbed.</p>

<p>"I suppose that is true, sir&mdash;but some of the
sailors are getting very anxious. I don't care to
mention their names, but they think some sail ought
to be taken in."</p>

<p>The master of the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> arose and
stretched himself. Then he put on the shoes he
had dropped on lying down, and came out into the
cabin. He gave one look at the barometer and his
sleepiness vanished.</p>

<p>"I should say there was a storm coming!" he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
exclaimed, and ran for the companionway. He
was soon on deck, and cast an anxious eye around.</p>

<p>"Mr. Shepley, why haven't you shortened sail?"
he demanded, in a low but sharp voice.</p>

<p>"I didn't think it necessary, just yet," was the
cool response.</p>

<p>"I don't agree with you," returned the master of
the bark, shortly, and then, without delay, gave
orders to take in fully half the sails, while the
crew were ordered to remain in readiness to stow
away still more of the canvas at a moment's notice.
The sailors, for the most part, worked with a will,
although there were several laggards, for laziness
among certain classes of men is not confined to the
land alone.</p>

<p>Captain Marshall was angry, and he did not
hesitate to let the first mate know it.</p>

<p>"There is no sense in taking too many risks," he
remarked, after his orders had been obeyed. "That
storm is coming, as sure as fate."</p>

<p>"I wanted to make as much headway as possible
before it struck us," grumbled Shepley. "We
haven't suffered any."</p>

<p>"No, but we might have lost a topmast or a topsail.
After this, you will please be a little more
careful."</p>

<p>There was no time to argue the matter, for a
little later the storm began in earnest. All of the
sails were taken in but the fore sheet, and this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
reefed down, allowing just enough canvas to fly to
keep the bark before the wind. The breeze was
turning to half a gale, and from a distance came
the rumble of thunder. Then the sky grew still
blacker and a flash of lightning illuminated the
angry waters.</p>

<p>Dave had followed Captain Marshall on deck,
but now he went below once more, to learn how
Phil and Roger were faring. He found them both
out in the cabin, having come from their staterooms
in alarm.</p>

<p>"Is it very bad outside?" questioned the senator's
son.</p>

<p>"Not yet, but I am afraid it is going to be," was
Dave's reply.</p>

<p>"Phew, that certainly means business!" burst
out Roger, as another flash of lightning was followed
by a heavy peal of thunder. "I hope the
ship weathers it all right."</p>

<p>"Captain Marshall is on deck, and he knows
what he is doing," answered Dave. "I am glad I
called him up," he added.</p>

<p>"Oh, so you called him up, did you?" came in a
voice from the cabin doorway, and, turning, Dave
beheld Paul Shepley there. The mate had come
below to get his raincoat.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," answered the country boy, boldly.
Now that the truth was out, he did not mean to
mince matters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thought you knew more about running a ship
than I did, eh?"</p>

<p>"I thought it was time to take in sail&mdash;and so did
the captain."</p>

<p>"Humph! This blow isn't going to kill anybody,
and we want to take all the advantage of the
wind that we can. We are expected to make a
quick trip, but we can't do it if we are going to
haul down sail all the time."</p>

<p>"I am sure Captain Marshall will do what is
right," said Phil.</p>

<p>"Really?" sneered the mate. "I didn't ask you
to put in your oar."</p>

<p>"I know you didn't&mdash;but my father owns the
vessel, and I shall stand by Captain Marshall and
by my friend, Dave Porter."</p>

<p>"Oh, so it's something of a plot against me,
eh?" snorted the mate, more angry than ever.
"Well, don't let it go too far." And he turned
into his own room, banging the door after him.
A minute later he came out, wearing his raincoat,
and hurried out on deck once more.</p>

<p>"He's a real nice man, I don't think," was
Roger's comment. "My, how he would lord it
over us, if he dared!"</p>

<p>"He is certainly sore," said Phil. "I must say,
in a way, he and the supercargo are a team. When
I get a chance, I am going to write to father and let
him know exactly the sort of fellows they are."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys felt little like discussing the subject
further just then, for the storm had now burst over
the vessel in all of its mad fury. The wind was
whistling through the rigging, making the masts
and yards creak and groan, and the rain came down
in sheets, sweeping the decks by the bucketful. It
was with difficulty that the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> could be
kept before the wind. The waves were running like
so many big hills, with the bark first on a crest and
then down in a valley between. The sky was almost
black, lit up occasionally by flashes of lightning
that were blinding.</p>

<p>"We'll go to the bottom, sure!" groaned Roger,
for at least the tenth time. "I'd rather be at Oak
Hall any day than in such a storm as this." He was
still seasick, but the storm made him forget the
ailment for the time being; and what was true of
the senator's son in this regard was likewise true
of Phil.</p>

<p>"I think I'll take another look on deck," said
Dave, as the bark gave a pitch that sent them all
against a partition.</p>

<p>"Take care that you don't fall overboard," returned
Phil.</p>

<p>"I'll be on my guard, never fear."</p>

<p>Putting on his raincoat, the country boy made
his way cautiously up the companionway. The
moment he stuck his head into the open he realized
that it was blowing "great guns," and more. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
rain dashed violently into his face, drenching him
completely.</p>

<p>"This is no place for you, lad!" bellowed Captain
Marshall, trying to make himself heard above
the wind. "Better go below again."</p>

<p>"I'll be careful," pleaded Dave. "I love to
watch a storm&mdash;I always did, when I was on the
farm. I never thought of hiding, no matter how
hard it thundered or lightened."</p>

<p>The master of the bark gazed for a second at
him in admiration.</p>

<p>"Well, I was the same," he said. "But be careful,
and don't go close to the rail."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 404px;">

<span class="caption">Another flash lit up the scene.&mdash;<i><a href="#Page_179">Page&nbsp;179</a>.</i></span>
</div>

<p>Dave remained in the vicinity of the cabin.
When another flash lit up the scene, he saw Billy
Dill near the bow, stowing away some rope in the
most unconcerned fashion possible. The old tar
was in his element, and said afterward that the
storm had done him more good than gallons of
medicine would have accomplished. "Saterated me
with salt brine, an' thet's wot I needed," were his
words.</p>

<p>"How do you like it, now?" asked Captain Marshall,
coming up a little later, while there was something
of a lull.</p>

<p>"I don't mind it," answered Dave, smiling.
"It's a little excitement, and that is what I like."</p>

<p>"I am thankful that you called me when you
did."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"I did what I thought was best, sir. But I
reckon it has put me into a hole with your first
mate."</p>

<p>"Why, did you tell him anything?"</p>

<p>"No, but he overheard me telling the other boys
that I had called you. He didn't say much, but
he showed that he was angry."</p>

<p>"Humph! Well, don't you mind, Porter. It
was the right thing to do. Shepley is a good sailor,
but once in a while he takes risks that I don't like.
If he troubles you about this, let me know, do you
hear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; but I am willing to fight my own
battles."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it, for you are gritty, I can see
that. Nevertheless, you let me know."</p>

<p>"How long do you suppose this storm will last?"</p>

<p>"There is no telling, perhaps twenty-four hours
and maybe two or three days. We are paying up
for that nice weather we had," concluded the
captain.</p>

<p>Finding he could do nothing on deck, and that
he was getting wet through, Dave went below and
to his stateroom. He found Roger and Phil lying
down as before, and as miserable as ever. A little
later supper was announced, but Dave had to eat
alone, for neither the captain nor the mate came to
join in the repast. It was a meal under difficulties,
and Dave did not remain at the table long. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
asked Roger and Phil if they wanted anything, but
both declined.</p>

<p>"Why, the very idea of anything to eat makes
me sicker than ever," declared the senator's son.</p>

<p>The storm did not abate during the evening, and
the three boys spent rather a dismal time of it in
the cabin and the staterooms. As night came on,
none of them felt like going to bed, although advised
to do so by Captain Marshall.</p>

<p>"We have seen the worst of the blow," said the
master of the <i>Stormy Petrel</i>, coming down about
ten o'clock.</p>

<p>It was not until morning that Dave fell into a
troubled doze, from which he did not awaken until
Roger shook him.</p>

<p>"Hello! I went to sleep, after all!" cried the
country boy. "What time is it?"</p>

<p>"About seven o'clock, Dave. There is something
unusual going on on deck," continued the
senator's son.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I am going up to see, and so
is Phil."</p>

<p>The three were soon ready, and crawled up the
companionway and out on the rain-drenched and
slippery deck.</p>

<p>"We must man the pumps," they heard Captain
Marshall cry. "And, Scader, report as soon as
you can."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir!" came from Scader, who was
the ship's carpenter. "But I am afraid, sir, it's a
bad leak to get at," he added.</p>

<p>"Have we sprung a leak?" cried Phil.</p>

<p>"We have," answered the captain. His face
wore a serious look, and the boys saw that he was
much troubled.</p>

<p>The sailors were at the pumps, and worked away
with a will. Roger and Phil still felt too weak to
take part, but Dave leaped to Billy Dill's side and
worked as hard as any of the foremast hands.
Leaving the ship in charge of the first mate, Captain
Marshall went below, to learn what the ship's
carpenter might have to say about the condition of
affairs.</p>

<p>"We are bringing up a good deal of water, are
we not?" asked Dave of Billy Dill.</p>

<p>"You have it right, lad; more water nor I care
to see," answered the old tar.</p>

<p>"That means the leak is a bad one, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, some of the ship's seams must be wide
open."</p>

<p>"Will it sink us?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell anything more about that than you,
Dave. We must hope for the best," replied Billy
Dill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>CAVASA ISLAND AT LAST</h3>


<p>Phil and Roger heard the conversation between
Dave and the old sailor, and it worried them so
much that they hurried below, to learn what might
be going on.</p>

<p>"We must shift that part of the cargo first,"
came from the ship's carpenter. "Then, I think, I
can do something, but I am not sure."</p>

<p>Captain Marshall at once ordered the cargo
shifted as desired. This did not please the supercargo,
but the master of the vessel paid no attention
to Van Blott's objections.</p>

<p>"It is a question of keeping the ship afloat, Mr.
Van Blott," said he, coldly. "If necessary, I'll
have the whole cargo heaved overboard."</p>

<p>"But, sir&mdash;&mdash;" commenced the supercargo.</p>

<p>"I can't talk about it now. My duty is to save
the ship. Do you want to go to the bottom of the
ocean?" And Captain Marshall spoke in such a
decided way that Jasper Van Blott sneaked off and
said no more for the time being.</p>

<p>A portion of the crew came below, and not
without difficulty a number of heavy boxes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
casks were shifted. Then the ship's carpenter and
an assistant went to work to tighten up the seams,
through which the water of the ocean was spurting
furiously. It was a difficult and dangerous task,
and it lasted the best part of three hours. But, at
last, the workers got the better of the elements, and
then the water went down steadily in the ship's well,
as the men at the pumps continued their labors.</p>

<p>"Will the ship pull through?" asked Phil, of the
captain.</p>

<p>"Yes, my lad, I think we are safe now&mdash;unless
the blow makes us open some more seams."</p>

<p>After the repairs below had been made and the
alarm had passed, Captain Marshall called the
first mate to his side.</p>

<p>"I thought you said those seams were all right
when we were at the dock at San Francisco," he
began.</p>

<p>"They looked all right," mumbled Paul Shepley.</p>

<p>"You couldn't have examined them very
closely."</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Humph! After this I had better look to things
myself," was the captain's comment, and he moved
away.</p>

<p>A little later the supercargo and the first mate
met in the waist. The storm was now dying down
rapidly, and it looked as if the sun would soon
break through the clouds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I see you had another run-in with the old
man," remarked Van Blott.</p>

<p>"So did you."</p>

<p>"You mean about the cargo?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't want him to nose around too
much," and the supercargo grinned.</p>

<p>"Afraid he might run across some of that private
stuff?"</p>

<p>"Hush! Somebody might hear you, Shepley.
What was your row about?"</p>

<p>"He laid the opening of the seams on my shoulders&mdash;said
I didn't inspect things properly at San
Francisco."</p>

<p>"He seems to be getting harder than ever
on us."</p>

<p>"That's it, and I am done, after this trip,"
growled the first mate.</p>

<p>"So am I&mdash;if I can make my little pile."</p>

<p>"That's what I mean. Van Blott, we must do
it, too."</p>

<p>"I expect to, but it isn't going to be so easy as
we thought. The owner of the ship has sent his
son to watch me, and he and those other lads are
rather clever."</p>

<p>"Pooh! you are not afraid of those boys, are
you?"</p>

<p>"It isn't that. I'm afraid they'll discover something
and take the news to the old man."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Here the talk had to come to an end, and the
two men separated, promising to meet in the evening.
That they had some scheme they wished to
work, there could not be the slightest doubt.</p>

<p>By nightfall the storm was at an end, and the
sun set in a perfect blaze of glory. Of the gale
only a stiff breeze remained, and Captain Marshall
lost no time in setting his sails as before. All the
loose seams had been mended and the <i>Stormy Petrel</i>
now took in no more water than was usual with her,
and is usual with ordinary sea-going craft.</p>

<p>"I am glad that is over," remarked Phil, the
next day, after a fair night's sleep.</p>

<p>"So am I, and I never want to experience another
such storm," came from Roger.</p>

<p>"How do you both feel?" asked Dave.</p>

<p>"My seasickness is gone, thank goodness," answered
Phil.</p>

<p>"Ditto here," said the senator's son. "Dave,
you are a lucky dog, to keep so well," he added, a
bit enviously.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it will be my turn next time, Roger."</p>

<p>After that the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> continued on her
course for many days with but little out of the ordinary
happening. Once or twice the boys had some
sharp words with the first mate, and Phil had a
"tiff" with the supercargo, but nothing like an open
quarrel ensued. Yet the flames were smoldering,
ready to break out at the first opportunity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"Those two men hate us worse than poison,"
said Dave, one day. "I can see it plainly."</p>

<p>"That supercargo has it in for me," replied Phil.
"I wish I could let my father know just how he is
acting. He'd soon lose his situation."</p>

<p>They were now near the equator, and the
weather was very warm, and would have been
unendurably hot, had it not been for the constant
breeze that was blowing. Nobody cared to do
much in such an atmosphere, and the three boys
were content to sit around or loll in hammocks
suspended in shady portions of the deck. The
broiling sun started the tar from the seams, and
the odor therefrom was almost overpowering.</p>

<p>"I wish we had an ice-making machine on
board," said Roger, as he fanned himself. They
had taken ice along, but the supply was running
low, and he could not get quite as much as he
desired.</p>

<p>"Never mind, we'll have a run ashore soon,"
said Dave. "That will be something of a change."</p>

<p>He had in mind the stop at Christmas Island, a
small body of land belonging to England and lying
in the Pacific, close to the equator. The island was
sighted the next day, and they made a landing and
roamed around for three hours, while some fresh
water and other things were taken on board. Then,
by nightfall, the bow of the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> was
once more headed for the southwestward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now we are in southern seas," cried Dave, one
day, after the equator had been left behind. "I
suppose we'll begin to sight some of the numerous
islands before long."</p>

<p>"I shan't mind sighting the islands, but I don't
want to run on some hidden reef," returned Roger.
"The charts show a great number of reefs in this
portion of the ocean."</p>

<p>Once more the days slipped by. It was fearfully
hot, and the boys did not move, excepting when it
was absolutely necessary. Occasionally they would
sit at the bow and Billy Dill would tell them stories
of the sea and of sights in foreign lands. He now
said that he felt as of old.</p>

<p>"I was born for the sea," he observed. "It was
a mistake for me to travel all the way across land
to Oakdale, an' I reckon I got punished fer it."</p>

<p>"I am sorry you suffered, but I am glad I had
the chance to meet you," answered Dave. "It may
mean a great deal to me, you know."</p>

<p>"Thet's true, Dave. But take my advice an'
don't depend upon it too much. I'd hate awfully
to see ye disapp'inted."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but I wish we were at Cavasa Island,"
said the country boy, wistfully.</p>

<p>The nearer the ship drew to the island mentioned,
the more anxious did he become, although
he did his best to conceal his feelings. But Phil
and Roger understood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>"I sincerely hope Dave isn't disappointed," said
the senator's son, when he and Phil chanced to be
alone. "Think of coming such a distance as this
on a wild-goose chase!"</p>

<p>"Well, it was the only thing to do," answered
the son of the bark owner. "You and I would
have done the same."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it. But, look at it from every
point of view, it is an odd situation. I only hope
this Dunston Porter is still at Cavasa Island, or in
that vicinity."</p>

<p>At last came the day when Captain Marshall
called the boys to him and said they might sight
Cavasa Island inside of the next twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>"You'll know the island at a glance," said he.
"Approaching it from this side, it looks exactly
like a long loaf of bread with a hump in the middle.
The hump is the old volcano. The town at which
we are to stop is located at the western extremity
of the island. There is where the real shipping is
done. There is a town at the eastern end, but the
harbor is poor, and most of the inhabitants are
natives."</p>

<p>"And what of the people where we are to stop?"
asked Dave.</p>

<p>"About one-half are natives and the others a
mixture of Americans and Europeans. The harbor
there is a very good one indeed, and that is why it
is so popular."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>As they neared Cavasa Island, both the supercargo
and the first mate appeared to grow more
than ordinarily anxious, and talked together by the
half-hour. Dave noticed this and so did the others.</p>

<p>"They have something in mind," said the country
boy to Phil. "You'll surely have to be on guard
when the cargo for Tolao is taken ashore."</p>

<p>The next day the boys kept on the lookout, having
borrowed Captain Marshall's best glass.
About noon Roger uttered a loud cry:</p>

<p>"I see something! It must be the island!"</p>

<p>"Let me look!" exclaimed Dave, and took the
glass. "Yes, it is Cavasa Island!" he went on,
"for it looks exactly as the captain said."</p>

<p>Inside of an hour they could see Cavasa Island
quite plainly, and by nightfall they were ready to
enter the harbor. But this was not to be accomplished
in the dark, and so they had to remain outside
until daybreak, impatient as Dave was to get
ashore.</p>

<p>"What an odd collection of ships!" said Phil, as
the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> made her way into the harbor.
"They must have come from all parts of the
world!" And this remark was largely true.</p>

<p>It had been arranged that Dave and Billy Dill
should go ashore at the first opportunity, and Roger
was to go with them.</p>

<p>"I am sorry I can't go," said Phil, to Dave.
"But, you understand how it is," and he jerked his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
thumb in the direction of the supercargo, who was
writing in one of his books.</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand, Phil," answered Dave. "I
hope you don't have any trouble."</p>

<p>The shipping of Tolao was very much huddled
together, and the boys had to depend upon Billy
Dill to pilot them to the main thoroughfare of the
town. The old sailor declared that the place had
changed but little since his last visit, and said he
would take them directly to the hotel at which
Dunston Porter had been in the habit of stopping.</p>

<p>"All right," said Dave. "You can't get there
any too quick for me," and they walked on, with
the heart of the country boy beating as it had seldom
beat before. To him, his whole future seemed
to rest upon what he might learn in the next few
hours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>ABOUT SOME MISSING MEN</h3>


<p>The hotel proved to be a one-story building of
Spanish architecture, with numerous small windows
and a rather low door. It was presided over by a
round-faced Englishman, who stared at Billy Dill
curiously when the old tar presented himself.</p>

<p>"Do you remember me, Mr. Chadsey?" asked
the sailor.</p>

<p>"I do," was the answer. "You were here some
years ago. But I cannot recall your name."</p>

<p>"Billy Dill."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes; you were with Mr. Porter and
Mr. Lemington," returned the hotel-keeper.</p>

<p>"That's it. I am looking for Mr. Porter now."</p>

<p>"Sorry, but he isn't here."</p>

<p>"Isn't here?" cried Dave, and his heart sank.
"Isn't he in town at all?"</p>

<p>"No, he left the island a couple of months ago."</p>

<p>"And where did he go to?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. He said something about going
to Sobago Island and something about going to
Australia, but where he really did go to, I have
not learned."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>"This young man is very much interested in
meeting Mr. Porter," explained Billy Dill. "His
name is Porter, too, and I reckon they are related.
Have you any idea where we can find out where
Dunston Porter went?"</p>

<p>"Might find out at the shipping offices."</p>

<p>"Why, of course!" exclaimed Dave. "Let us
go to the different offices at once."</p>

<p>Billy Dill was willing, and without loss of time
led the way to the street upon which the majority
of the shipping of Cavasa Island was booked. The
offices were mostly small and rather dirty, and
around them hung sailors and other men, of various
nationalities, and some of them far from <a name="possess" id="possess"></a><ins title="Original has preposessing">prepossessing</ins>
in their general appearance.</p>

<p>They visited two offices without success, and
then came to a place located on a corner, with doors
on both streets.</p>

<p>"Hello!" cried Roger. "There is Mr. Van
Blott just ahead of us! Is this the shipping firm
with which Mr. Lawrence does business?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it is," answered Billy Dill.</p>

<p>"Then what is he doing here?"</p>

<p>"Must have a little business of his own," said
Dave. "But I don't care. Come along." Just
then he was thinking only of his personal affairs.</p>

<p>They entered the office, which reeked of tobacco
smoke and the smell of rum. In the rear was
another office, and they were just in time to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the supercargo go into this, shutting a partition
door behind him.</p>

<p>Looking around, Dave saw a clerk at a corner
desk looking over some papers with an elderly
German.</p>

<p>"I will be at liberty in a few minutes," said the
clerk, in broken English. "Please to take seats,"
and he pointed to a couple of low benches set
against the wall and the partition.</p>

<p>Billy Dill sat down on the bench along the wall
and Dave and Roger upon that next to the partition,
which was not over seven feet in height.
Save for the rattling of the papers at the corner
desk the office was very quiet, and the boys readily
heard the talk going on behind the partition.</p>

<p>"So you really have some goots on board?"
came in a somewhat German voice. "I vos afraid
you vould not bring any."</p>

<p>"Didn't I say I'd bring them, Baumann?" returned
Jasper Van Blott. "I've got them, and the
only question is, how am I to get them here, and
when are you going to pay me?"</p>

<p>"I pay so soon as de goots is here," said the
German shipping agent. "I not pay a dollar
before."</p>

<p>"But you will send your men down to the dock?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I do dot. Vot dime you vonts dem,
hey?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning at eight o'clock, sharp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Tell them to watch me, and when I wave my
handkerchief they can come forward and get the
goods."</p>

<p>"How many poxes vos dere?"</p>

<p>"Sixteen, all told. You want to be careful and
caution your men. I don't want Captain Marshall
to learn what I am&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The boys heard no more, for at this juncture the
clerk came forward, having finished his work at
the corner desk.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you?" he asked, blandly.</p>

<p>"I am looking for a man who is supposed to have
left Cavasa Island by steamer, or sailboat, about
two months ago," said Dave. "His name is Dunston
Porter. Can you tell me if he shipped from
here?"</p>

<p>The clerk looked over a book he drew from a
desk.</p>

<p>"I see nothing of the name," he said, after a
pause.</p>

<p>"You would have the name, if he had taken
passage from here?" questioned Roger.</p>

<p>The clerk nodded. Then, when he found that
he could do nothing more for them, he dropped
into an easy chair, lit a black-looking cigar and
took up a newspaper.</p>

<p>"There is one more shipping office," said Billy
Dill, as he led the way to the street. "We'll go
there."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dave, did you hear that talk in the back
room?" questioned the senator's son, as they were
hurrying down the street.</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"What do you think of it?"</p>

<p>"I think the supercargo is up to some game, and
we must tell Phil and Captain Marshall."</p>

<p>"That's just my idea, too, Dave. Let me see,
the name of the firm was Baumann &amp; Feltmuller,
wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>They were soon at the last of the shipping offices.
Here the clerk could scarcely talk English, and
they had to call in the services of a gentleman who
chanced to be present and who could speak the
native tongue. A booking list was consulted, and
it was announced that Dunston Porter had taken
passage for Nanpi, on Sobago Island, just six
weeks before.</p>

<p>"Six weeks!" cried Dave. "I hope he is there
still. Now, how can I communicate with him,
Roger?"</p>

<p>"You can send him a letter," answered Roger.
"But you must remember that the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> is
going to Nanpi as soon as her cargo for this town
is unloaded."</p>

<p>From the shipping clerk they learned that Dunston
Porter had gone to Sobago alone&mdash;that is,
without his partner, Mr. Lemington. A further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
searching into the shipping lists revealed the fact
that the partner had sailed for Australia seven
weeks past.</p>

<p>"I reckon they dissolved partnership," observed
Billy Dill, "an' one went his way, an' tudder the
other way. An' I likewise guess they didn't git
thet treasure."</p>

<p>There was now nothing to do but to return to
the bark, and this they did without delay. The
boys found that Captain Marshall had gone ashore
on business, and so called Phil aside and related to
him what had been heard in the office of Baumann
&amp; Feltmuller.</p>

<p>"You are right&mdash;there is something in the wind,"
said the shipowner's son. "I wish the captain was
here, so I could consult with him."</p>

<p>"He'll be back soon, won't he?" questioned
Roger.</p>

<p>"He said he might not be back until late this
evening."</p>

<p>Phil was interested in what Dave had to tell
about Dunston Porter, and said he would urge the
captain of the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> to set sail for Nanpi
at the earliest possible moment.</p>

<p>It was not until ten o'clock that Jasper Van
Blott came back to the bark. He immediately
walked up to the first mate and the pair engaged
in conversation for some time. Then the supercargo
went to bed, and Roger and Dave did the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
same. Phil sat up, reading and awaiting the captain's
return.</p>

<p>It was almost seven o'clock when the country
boy sprang up and awakened the senator's son.
Both hurried into their clothes and then into the
cabin, where they met Phil, whose face was full of
worry.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked both.</p>

<p>"Captain Marshall hasn't come back yet."</p>

<p>"Hasn't come back?" ejaculated Dave. "Do
you mean to say he stayed away all night?"</p>

<p>"Exactly; and I don't know what to make of it."</p>

<p>"Did he say he might remain away?" came from
Roger.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Where did he go?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, and neither does Mr. Shepley."</p>

<p>"What will you do about&mdash;&mdash;" began Dave, and
cut himself short, as Jasper Van Blott came into the
cabin.</p>

<p>"Mr. Van Blott, do you know anything about
the captain?" questioned Phil.</p>

<p>"I do not," was the short reply.</p>

<p>"It is queer that he should stay away all
night."</p>

<p>"Oh, captains like to have good times occasionally,"
continued the supercargo, with a sickly grin.</p>

<p>"If you mean by that, that Captain Marshall
went off to have a good time, as you put it, I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
think so," returned Phil, coldly. "He is not that
sort."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you know him better than I do," flared
up the supercargo.</p>

<p>"I know that he is a man who sticks to his duty,
Mr. Van Blott. Something has gone wrong, or
he would be back."</p>

<p>"As you please." The supercargo paused.
"Well, it doesn't matter much," he continued. "I
know what to do, and I am going ahead without
waiting for him."</p>

<p>"You mean about unloading?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Would it not be better to wait until Captain
Marshall returns?"</p>

<p>"No, it would only be a waste of time."</p>

<p>No more was said just then, and a few minutes
later breakfast was announced. As soon as it was
over, Phil called his chums aside.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd do me a favor," he whispered.
"Go ashore and try to hunt up the captain. He
must be around somewhere. I will try to hold the
supercargo back as much as I can."</p>

<p>Dave and the senator's son were willing, and in
less than ten minutes were on the dock and moving
for the streets beyond.</p>

<p>"Where are those boys going?" asked Jasper
Van Blott, coming up to Phil.</p>

<p>"They are going to look for Captain Marshall."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>"Humph!" muttered the supercargo, and said
no more.</p>

<p>"I think we had better wait until the captain
returns," went on Phil.</p>

<p>"I am not going to wait," snapped Van Blott.
"I am going to get that cargo ashore as quickly as
it can be done."</p>

<p>And fifteen minutes later the hatches were
opened and the work of getting out the boxes,
barrels, and casks began.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH THE SUPERCARGO IS CORNERED</h3>


<p>From one street corner Dave and Roger hurried
to another, looking in every direction for some sign
of Captain Marshall. This hunt they kept up for
the best part of half an hour, but without success.</p>

<p>"He is certainly nowhere in this vicinity," said
the senator's son. "I wonder where he can be
keeping himself."</p>

<p>They walked on more slowly, and at the entrance
to a lane came to another halt. Then, chancing
to look into the lane, Dave uttered a short cry:</p>

<p>"There he is!"</p>

<p>Coming along the lane was Captain Marshall.
His step was an uncertain one, and he pitched
from side to side. As the two boys ran forward,
the master of the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> gave a lurch and
landed on some old boxes with a crash.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave, can this be possible!" murmured
Roger. "I did not think the captain would do it."</p>

<p>"Let us help him to the ship," answered Dave.
He was as much shocked as his companion, and he
could not help but think of what the supercargo
had said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, is it you, boys?" mumbled the captain, as
he espied them. "I want to&mdash;to get back to the
ship."</p>

<p>"We'll help you," said Dave.</p>

<p>"I've had an awful night&mdash;my mind is in a
perfect whirl," went on the master of the <i>Stormy
Petrel</i>.</p>

<p>"We'll soon have you safe on the bark," put in
Roger.</p>

<p>The two assisted the captain to his feet. His
eyes had a peculiar stare in them. Suddenly he
clapped his hand to his pocket.</p>

<p>"Funny!" he muttered. "Very funny! I've got
my watch! And I've got my money, too!"</p>

<p>"Did you think they were gone?" queried Dave.</p>

<p>"Well, I shouldn't be&mdash;be surprised. I thought
they did it to rob me. What time is it? Oh, but
I am weak in the legs, boys!"</p>

<p>"It is about eight o'clock."</p>

<p>"In the morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I must get back to the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> by
all means. I&mdash;how did you come to find me?"</p>

<p>"We were out looking for you," answered
Roger. "We were alarmed, and so was Phil, because
you didn't come back last night."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I meant to come back. Oh, how my head
spins! I wish I had a drink of water! That coffee
they dosed me with was vile."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"Coffee they dosed you with?" queried Dave.
"Were you drugged?"</p>

<p>"I must have been, lad. I met some men, and
they wanted me to drink with them. I refused.
Then they offered me some coffee and native cakes,
and, to be sociable, I took the stuff. Directly afterward
I began to grow sleepy, and then I didn't
know a thing until I woke up at the end of that
lane awhile ago."</p>

<p>"Did you know the men?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"I did not, but they pretended to know me. It's
queer they didn't rob me. I wonder why they
drugged me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Dave, "unless&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unless what?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't like to say, Captain Marshall. But
I'll tell you one thing, you are wanted on board of
the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> at once."</p>

<p>"Who wants me?"</p>

<p>"Phil Lawrence. We have learned something
about Mr. Van Blott which we think you ought to
know. But you must get your head cleared up, first
of all."</p>

<p>They walked the captain back to the bark, and,
by accident more than design, managed to get the
skipper on board without the supercargo seeing the
party. Then they called Phil into the cabin, and
in the meantime got the captain some fresh water
and some other things they fancied might do him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
good. They were glad to note that his dizziness
was fast leaving him.</p>

<p>"This looks suspicious to me," said Captain
Marshall, after he had heard what the boys had
to relate. "But I cannot accuse Van Blott of
having me drugged, as I have no proof of it. I
do not know who those men were, and, more than
likely, they will keep themselves out of sight."</p>

<p>"That is true," returned Phil. "But you can
help me regarding this stuff to be taken away by
Baumann &amp; Feltmuller, can't you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Phil. I want to know all about that
stuff before it leaves this ship. Have you the
records of the goods?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; Mr. Van Blott has locked the books in
the safe."</p>

<p>"Then, if I were you, as your father's representative,
I should demand to see the records. I
will back you up."</p>

<p>"If you will back me up, I'll go to him at once.
He is already getting the goods out of the hold."</p>

<p>"I'll put a stop to that," answered the captain.</p>

<p>He was still feeble in the legs, but managed to
climb to the deck, and walked to where the supercargo
and the first mate were directing the unloading
of a portion of the cargo.</p>

<p>"Hello, so you are back!" exclaimed the supercargo,
and his face paled a little.</p>

<p>"I am," returned the captain, coldly. "Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Shepley, did you give orders to unload?" he went
on, turning to the mate.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;did," stammered the mate. "You
said yesterday we were to start first thing this
morning."</p>

<p>"I did&mdash;but I expected to be here when we
began. Mr. Van Blott, Philip Lawrence wishes to
see you in your office."</p>

<p>"I haven't time to bother with him now,"
growled the supercargo. "Go ahead with those
cases!" he shouted to some stevedores who were
nearby, and pulling out his handkerchief he gave
it a flourish toward the dock.</p>

<p>"Drop those cases!" roared Captain Marshall,
his face growing red. "Drop them, I say!" And
the natives who were carrying the cases stopped
short.</p>

<p>"Captain Marshall&mdash;&mdash;" began Jasper Van
Blott. "I&mdash;what do you mean by this&mdash;er&mdash;by
this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I told you that Philip Lawrence wanted to see
you in your office. You had better see him before
we move any more of this cargo."</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I won't argue the matter, Mr. Van Blott. I
was drugged last night. Do you understand?
Drugged! But my mind is clear now, and I want
everything on this bark to run smoothly. You had
better go to your office, and I'll go with you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>The supercargo glared at the captain, and the
latter glared in return. Then Van Blott shrugged
his shoulders.</p>

<p>"As you please," he said. "But it is a strange
proceeding." And he walked to that part of the
ship where was located his little office. As he
passed the first mate, he gave the man a wink and
turned his eyes toward the cases on the deck. Paul
Shepley nodded slightly.</p>

<p>In the office they found Phil awaiting them.
Roger followed the pair, but Dave had seen the
wink that was passed, and remained on deck, and
a moment later seated himself on one of the very
cases the stevedores had been in the act of removing
from the ship.</p>

<p>"Ain't you going with them?" asked the first
mate, coming up with a dark frown on his face.</p>

<p>"No, I think I'll stay here until they come back,"
answered Dave, lightly.</p>

<p>"Then please get off of that box."</p>

<p>"I am not hurting the box, Mr. Shepley."</p>

<p>"Get off, I say!"</p>

<p>The boy from the country did so.</p>

<p>"I believe Captain Marshall wanted nothing
moved until he came back," said Dave, gazing
boldly into the mate's angry face. "Perhaps I had
better call him, if you are going to work again."</p>

<p>"Who said I was going to move anything?"
growled Paul Shepley, his manner showing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
that was just what he had had in mind to do.
"Don't you get too fresh around me, or there will
be trouble!"</p>

<p>"Well, if there is trouble, I'll do my best to stand
up against it."</p>

<p>"Aw! you make me tired!" grumbled the first
mate, and strode away in deep disgust, leaving
Dave master of the field.</p>

<p>In the meantime a stormy meeting was being
held in the supercargo's office. At first Van Blott
flatly refused to allow Phil to look at his books, but
at last brought forth several, which the shipowner's
son knew were of little importance.</p>

<p>"I want the books that relate to the goods to be
landed here," said Phil. "I want to know all about
each piece before it is put ashore."</p>

<p>"Humph! You are getting very particular,
young man!" observed the supercargo.</p>

<p>"I do not deny it."</p>

<p>"Did your father send you on this trip to spy
on me?"</p>

<p>"You may put it that way, if you wish, Mr. Van
Blott. I am here simply to learn this business and
to see that everything is O. K."</p>

<p>"If everything is all right, what have you to fear
from an inspection like this?" came suggestively
from Captain Marshall.</p>

<p>"I am not going to work here and be watched
like a criminal!" stormed Jasper Van Blott. "If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
old man Lawrence can't trust me, it is time we
parted company!"</p>

<p>"I agree with you," returned the captain.</p>

<p>"Do you?" came with a sneer. "Very well. I'll
close up my accounts and quit."</p>

<p>"You'll not do it just yet," put in Phil. He was
pale, but determined.</p>

<p>"I won't?"</p>

<p>"No. Before you quit you must make an accounting
to me of goods and money, and satisfy me,
and also Captain Marshall, that everything is O. K.
in every particular."</p>

<p>"Bah! Boy, who gave you authority to talk to
me in this fashion?"</p>

<p>"My father."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it. Why, you are a mere boy&mdash;you
don't know what you are saying. I'll close
up this business to suit myself and leave my keys
with Captain Marshall, and that will end it."</p>

<p>"Mr. Van Blott, you must remember that Philip
Lawrence is the shipowner's son," said the captain,
sternly.</p>

<p>"I don't care if he is. He has no legal authority,
and I don't propose to let him drive me."</p>

<p>"Just wait a minute, until I come back," said
Phil, starting for the door.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"To my stateroom. I'll be back in a few
minutes."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is he going to do?" questioned the supercargo,
uneasily.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Captain Marshall,
shortly. "But, if I were you, Mr. Van Blott, I
should listen to him. In a certain sense, he represents
his father on this vessel."</p>

<p>"He doesn't represent him with me!" muttered
the supercargo. His anger had made him lose a
good portion of his common sense.</p>

<p>There was a minute of silence, during which
Jasper Van Blott strode up and down the narrow
office. Then a step was heard outside, and Phil
reappeared, carrying a large envelope in his hand.</p>

<p>"My father said I was not to use this unless it
was necessary," he said, drawing a paper from the
envelope.</p>

<p>At the appearance of a legal-looking document
the supercargo started back.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he demanded, hoarsely.</p>

<p>"This is a document authorizing Captain Marshall
to take charge of your affairs, Mr. Van Blott.
He is to investigate everything, under my supervision,
and is to hold you strictly accountable for
everything you have done since starting on this
voyage."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>THE CARGO MYSTERY EXPLAINED</h3>


<p>There was a death-like silence for several seconds
after Phil made his announcement. Even
Captain Marshall was astonished, for he had not
anticipated such a turn of affairs.</p>

<p>"Let me see that paper!" demanded Jasper Van
Blott, wildly. "I will not believe a word of what
you have said until I read that paper."</p>

<p>"Then read it," answered the shipowner's son,
and passed it over.</p>

<p>With compressed lips, the supercargo perused
the document. Then he gritted his teeth.</p>

<p>"So this is the game you have been playing on
me, eh?" he snarled. "Well, it doesn't work."</p>

<p>"Doesn't work?" came from Roger, who was as
much interested as any one.</p>

<p>"No, it doesn't work. That paper isn't worth
the ink it's written with. It was drawn up in the
United States, and we are not in the United States
now."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, but we are sailing under the
United States flag, Mr. Van Blott," said Captain
Marshall, quickly. "Besides that, I think the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
authorities here will respect a legal document drawn
up in Uncle Sam's country."</p>

<p>"It's not worth a pinch of snuff!" roared the
supercargo, and would have torn the paper to bits,
had not Phil and Roger leaped forward and prevented
him.</p>

<p>"None of that!" cried Phil. "Let that alone,
or I'll have Captain Marshall place you under
arrest."</p>

<p>"Arrest? Me under arrest? I'd like to see you
do it!" fumed the supercargo.</p>

<p>"I'll do it, unless you do what is right," said the
master of the <i>Stormy Petrel</i>, quickly. "Mr. Van
Blott, your actions do you no credit. Trying to
destroy that document proves to me beyond a doubt
that you have something to conceal. I shall begin
an investigation at once, and the boys shall aid
me."</p>

<p>"I don't care!" roared Jasper Van Blott. "But
I am done with the ship and the whole crowd."</p>

<p>"Please hand over the keys to your safe boxes."</p>

<p>With bad grace, the supercargo did so.</p>

<p>"Now you will please sit down and let us go
through the accounts," continued the captain.</p>

<p>The supercargo squirmed and argued, and did
his best to get away, but it was all to no purpose,
and, in the end, he had to remain in the office until
the captain, Phil, and Roger had examined all the
shipping accounts. Some of the entries were mixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
up, and they could not obtain any satisfactory explanation
regarding them.</p>

<p>"Now we will go on deck and examine that stuff
that was to go ashore," said Captain Marshall.</p>

<p>"Especially the goods for Baumann &amp; Feltmuller,"
put in the senator's son.</p>

<p>"Ha! What do you know about that firm?"
gasped Jasper Van Blott.</p>

<p>"Not much."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you have been spying on me&mdash;you must
have followed me on shore," gasped the supercargo.
"But you are mistaken, you will find nothing
wrong," he added, suddenly, and then appeared
to calm down.</p>

<p>They went on deck, where they found Dave still
on guard. The first mate was sulking near the
rail. As soon as the captain appeared Dave walked
up to him.</p>

<p>"I am glad you are here," he whispered. "Mr.
Shepley wanted to send the goods ashore, but I told
him that, if he did so, I would call you."</p>

<p>"Is that so? Thank you, Dave, I am glad you
went on watch," replied the master of the <i>Stormy
Petrel</i>.</p>

<p>The inspection of the goods began, and in the
midst of the work Jasper Van Blott gave an exclamation.</p>

<p>"Did anybody bring that brown book up?" he
queried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Nobody knew anything about a brown book, and
all looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"That has this transaction in it in full," went on
the supercargo. "I remember now, I put the book
in my stateroom. I will go below and get it. That
will prove everything is as straight as a string.
Then I am going to sue somebody for heavy damages,"
he added.</p>

<p>He walked to the companionway and disappeared.
Captain Marshall continued to inspect
the goods to go ashore, and the boys aided him.
That something was wrong they did not doubt,
and they waited impatiently for the supercargo to
reappear with his brown book.</p>

<p>"The first mate has gone below, too," announced
Roger, presently. "Maybe the pair are talking it
over between them. They are certainly hand-in-glove
with each other, according to what Dave
says."</p>

<p>"Go below and tell Mr. Van Blott I want him to
come up at once," returned Captain Marshall.</p>

<p>The senator's son disappeared down the companionway
and was gone for several minutes. He
came up with a worried look on his face.</p>

<p>"I can't find Mr. Van Blott anywhere!" he cried.</p>

<p>"What!" roared the master of the <i>Stormy
Petrel</i>. "He must be down there."</p>

<p>"Unless he has sneaked ashore!" came quickly
from Dave.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Could he do that?" questioned Phil.</p>

<p>"He might."</p>

<p>"I will go below and look around," went on
Captain Marshall. "You boys scatter on the deck
and watch for him. He must not be allowed to
get away!"</p>

<p>The boys did as requested, and the captain went
below, to be gone quarter of an hour and more.
When he came up, his face was much downcast.</p>

<p>"He has certainly gotten away," he declared.
"His valise and some of his clothing are gone, and
his money box is wide open and empty."</p>

<p>"Where is the mate?" asked Phil.</p>

<p>"There he is!" exclaimed Dave, pointing to the
bow.</p>

<p>The captain ran forward.</p>

<p>"Mr. Shepley, have you seen Mr. Van Blott?"</p>

<p>"When?" inquired the mate, slowly.</p>

<p>"Within the last ten or twenty minutes."</p>

<p>"Why, yes."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"I think he walked ashore. I didn't notice, particularly."</p>

<p>"Humph! Did he have his valise?"</p>

<p>"I don't know but what he did. I wasn't paying
any particular attention. Are we to unload, or
not?" went on the first mate.</p>

<p>"We are to do nothing until Mr. Van Blott is
found," answered the captain, shortly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right; in that case, you'll wait a long time,"
murmured the mate to himself.</p>

<p>After that a regular hunt was instituted, and the
boys went ashore, along with Billy Dill. They even
visited the offices of Baumann &amp; Feltmuller, but
not a trace of the missing supercargo could be
found anywhere.</p>

<p>When the boys got back to the bark, they found
that Captain Marshall had begun on an examination
of the goods taken from the hold. He found
a number of cases mismarked&mdash;those which were
to have been sent to Baumann &amp; Feltmuller.</p>

<p>"This stuff seems to have been meant for some
firm in Australia&mdash;Featherstone &amp; Harmsworth,"
said the captain. "How it came on my ship is a
mystery to me."</p>

<p>"Wait!" shouted Dave. "I know something
about that. Just before we left San Francisco I
heard some dock officials speaking about some
costly cases of goods which had disappeared from
a neighboring dock. The goods were for the firm
of Featherstone &amp; Harmsworth, I remember the
name well. The stuff was to go to Sydney. They
said they had tried their best, but could get no trace
of the stolen cases."</p>

<p>"That explains it!" exclaimed Phil. "Van Blott
took the cases and had them stowed away in the
hold of this ship. He was going to sell the stuff
to Baumann &amp; Feltmuller, in part or in whole."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe you have struck the truth," returned
Captain Marshall. "And now, fearing exposure,
he has fled."</p>

<p>"What can you do with the goods?" questioned
Roger.</p>

<p>"I don't know, yet. Either return them to their
owners, or sell them and forward the money. I'll
have to think the matter over."</p>

<p>"What a rascal Van Blott has proved himself
to be!" was Phil's comment.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I reckon that man in San Francisco,
Bangor, was in with him," said Dave, and he was
correct in his surmise. It may be added here,
though, that Bangor never suffered for this crime,
for he was caught, shortly after the sailing of the
<i>Stormy Petrel</i>, and tried for something equally
unlawful, and sentenced to prison for several years.</p>

<p>The stolen goods were placed in another part of
the ship, and then the work of unloading a part of
the regular cargo began. Paul Shepley had to
superintend this work, and did so in a thoughtful
mood.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew the truth about the mate," said
Phil to Dave. "I am going to watch him pretty
closely after this."</p>

<p>"He certainly had something in common with
the supercargo," replied the country boy.</p>

<p>From Baumann &amp; Feltmuller, Captain Marshall
could learn but little. The merchants said that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
supercargo had offered to sell them some goods
which, he declared, had not been accepted by other
parties because of delay in shipment. They had
agreed to take the same and pay on delivery, and
when convinced that all was fair and above board.</p>

<p>"They are a tricky firm," said the captain to the
boys. "But, as I have no proof against them, I'll
have to let them go."</p>

<p>In spite of the excitement over the exposure of
the supercargo, Dave was anxious to sail from
Cavasa Island and be on the way to Sobago. It was
with great satisfaction that he heard Captain Marshall
say they would set sail on the following Monday
morning.</p>

<p>"And how long will it take us to reach Nanpi?"
he asked of the master of the <i>Stormy Petrel</i>.</p>

<p>"That will depend upon the wind, lad. If we
have luck, we ought to get there in four or five
days. But sometimes the wind is mighty contrary
around these parts."</p>

<p>While at Cavasa the boys spent one whole day
ashore, and went out riding in the direction of the
volcano in company with Billy Dill. The old tar
showed them where he and Dunston Porter and
Mr. Lemington had camped out, and where they
had hunted for the treasure.</p>

<p>"I'd like to feel an earthquake once, just for
fun," remarked Roger. "It must be a queer sensation."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is," answered Billy Dill. "An' one ye ain't
apt to forgit in a hurry."</p>

<p>"If it was bad, I think I'd be scared out of my
wits," said Phil. "What do you think about it,
Dave?"</p>

<p>"I don't want any in mine."</p>

<p>"Oh, what's a little earthquake!" cried the senator's
son. "It would be an experience worth talking
about, that's all."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe you'll have your wish gratified
before we leave this region of the globe," said
Dave. "I understand that earthquakes are common
for thousands of miles around. Sometimes
the quakes make new islands, while other islands
sink out of sight."</p>

<p>"Excuse me from being on an island when it
sinks out of sight," cried Phil. "I'd rather be on
solid ground any time." And in this statement the
others agreed with him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>SWEPT ONWARD BY A TIDAL WAVE</h3>


<p>"Off at last, and I am glad of it!"</p>

<p>"I suppose you are anxious to get to Nanpi,
Dave?"</p>

<p>"I am, Roger. Can you blame me?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. In fact, if I were in your place, I
think I'd be even more anxious. Meeting this
Dunston Porter means so much to you," went on
the senator's son.</p>

<p>The two chums were on the forward deck of the
<i>Stormy Petrel</i> and the bark was just leaving the
harbor of Tolao. It was a clear day, with a bright
sun high overhead, and the boys felt in excellent
spirits.</p>

<p>Nothing had been seen or heard of Jasper Van
Blott, and, with the sailing of the bark, he was
practically forgotten by Dave and Roger. But
Phil and the captain remembered him and were
sorry that they had not been able to bring the
wicked supercargo to justice.</p>

<p>Although he was in nominal authority, Captain
Marshall turned over the cargo books to Phil, and
the shipowner's son did very well when it came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
straightening out the tangle left by Van Blott.
Phil wished to make a clean report to his father and
worked with a will, until he "knew where he was
at," as he declared.</p>

<p>"I rather think it will open my father's eyes,"
said Phil. "He has suspected Van Blott for some
time, but he didn't think of anything like this."</p>

<p>On the second day out the wind died down
utterly, and this state of affairs continued for several
days. The sails flapped idly against the masts,
and scarcely any progress was made.</p>

<p>"We are not going to make such a quick passage,
after all," remarked Roger. "My! but this is
slow work, I must declare!"</p>

<p>"And haven't you noticed the heat?" added
Phil. "It seems to me to be unusually hot."</p>

<p>"It is," said Dave, who had been consulting a
thermometer. "This is our warmest day, by four
degrees. If it gets much warmer, we'll certainly
melt."</p>

<p>That afternoon the sea appeared to be strangely
agitated, and toward night the sailors noticed a
large number of dead fish rising to the surface.
Dave discovered a large shark, and this proved to
be dead, also.</p>

<p>"There has been some disturbance under the
ocean's surface," said Captain Marshall. "More
than likely an earthquake."</p>

<p>"An earthquake! And we never knew it!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
ejaculated Roger, and his tone showed his disappointment.</p>

<p>In the morning the sea was more agitated than
ever. One minute it would appear to flatten out,
the next, two waves would come together with a
clash that sent the spray flying upward for many
feet. More dead fish were in evidence on every
hand.</p>

<p>"I have never witnessed anything like this,"
commented Captain Marshall. "I trust it gets
no worse."</p>

<p>When the breeze sprang up, it came from the
wrong direction, and the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> had to tack
as best she could. The breeze kept growing stiffer
and stiffer, until it was little short of a gale. Then
a thick mist settled down on the ocean, shutting
out the view upon all sides.</p>

<p>"I must say I don't like this," observed the senator's
son. "Supposing we should run into something?"</p>

<p>"There isn't much to run into," replied Dave.
"I just asked the captain, and he told me we were
a good many miles from land of any sort."</p>

<p>"We might run into some other ship."</p>

<p>"There seem to be very few ships in this
locality."</p>

<p>Morning found the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> still surrounded
by the mist, and there was now little or no
wind. The barometer had gone down, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
captain ordered some sail taken in, in anticipation
of a storm.</p>

<p>At noon the mist appeared to lift a little, and
once more the wind sprang up. This continued for
several hours, when, of a sudden, a strange
humming filled the air.</p>

<p>"What can that be?" cried Dave, who was on
the forward deck.</p>

<p>"It's wind!" cried Billy Dill. "A reg'lar tornado,
too."</p>

<p>Captain Marshall was on deck, no longer disposed
to trust his first mate. He at once ordered
all of the sails taken in and stowed away securely.
This was just accomplished, when the hurricane&mdash;for
it was nothing less&mdash;struck the <i>Stormy Petrel</i>,
almost sending the bark on her beam ends.</p>

<p>"Better go below!" shrieked the captain to the
three boys. "It's not safe for you on deck."</p>

<p>"I'll be careful," answered Phil, but the master
of the bark shook his head, and then the three lads
started for the companionway, holding on to first
one thing and then another as they moved along.</p>

<p>Phil had just reached the bottom of the steps,
Roger was half-way down, and Dave still at the
top, when a wild cry from the bow reached their
ears.</p>

<p>"Hold tight, all of ye!" came in the voice of
Billy Dill. "Hold on, or ye'll be swept overboard,
sure!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Everybody on board the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> realized
that this could be no idle warning, and all held on
like grim death to anything that was handy. The
next moment there was a strange hissing and pounding
of the ocean, and, in a twinkling, the <i>Stormy
Petrel</i> was caught on what seemed to be the top of
a giant wave and carried along as if in the grip of
a demon of the deep!</p>

<p>The upward and forward movement came with
such a force that nearly everybody was taken clean
and clear off his feet, and had not each one clung
fast, as directed by Billy Dill, somebody must surely
have been flung overboard. The bark turned
around and around on the top of the wave, and
then lurched forward and went on and on, the
spray flying so thickly that scarcely a thing of
what was beyond could be seen.</p>

<p>"My gracious!" gasped Roger, who had been
flung down on top of Phil. "What is this?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me!" returned Dave, who was sitting
on the upper step with his arms entwined around
the companionway rail. "I guess it's an earthquake
and a hurricane rolled into one."</p>

<p>"Has anybody gone overboard?" asked Phil, as
he tried to stand up.</p>

<p>"I don't know. Billy Dill gave the warning."</p>

<p>The door to the cabin was open, and the three
lads fairly tumbled into the compartment. The
bark was rocking to such an extent that to stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
upright was out of the question. Everything that
was loose was on the floor, shifting from one side
to the other.</p>

<p>The boys waited with bated breath, and a few
minutes later heard a crash on the deck, which told
that a topmast, or one of the yards, had come down.
Then came a yell of alarm from one of the sailors.</p>

<p>"We are going to sink! We are going to sink!"</p>

<p>"Did you hear that?" ejaculated Roger. "He
said the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> was going to sink!"</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" put in Phil. "I don't want
to drown!"</p>

<p>Phil had scarcely spoken when a side door to one
of the staterooms burst open and a man came forth,
wild with terror, his face scratched and bleeding.
Much to their amazement, they saw it was Jasper
Van Blott.</p>

<p>"Is the ship really going down?" cried the
former supercargo, in a trembling voice.</p>

<p>"Where did you come from?" cried Dave.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;I've been in hiding. But, tell me, are
we going down?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;I must go on deck and see. It nearly
killed me, the bark bounced around so," went on
Van Blott.</p>

<p>He started for the companionway, but had not
yet reached the top when a big wave hit the <i>Stormy
Petrel</i> broadside, sweeping the deck from end to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
end and sending some of the water into the cabin.
The former supercargo was washed off the steps
and came down flat on his back, screaming with
terror.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 406px;">
<img src="images/p225.jpg" width="406" height="600" alt="The former supercargo was washed off the steps and came

<span class="caption">The former supercargo was washed off the steps and came
down flat on his back.&mdash;<i><a href="#Page_225">Page&nbsp;225</a>.</i></span>
</div>

<p>The boys were nearly as much alarmed, and, as
soon as it was possible to do so, all three crawled
up to where they could get a view of the deck and
the sea beyond.</p>

<p>The outlook was truly startling. The ocean was
whipped up into a milk-white foam and was dashing
and churning in all directions. One tremendous
wave was rolling straight to the southward,
and on this the bark was riding, like a monkey
on a runaway race horse. The wind was whistling
through the rigging, and the sky was filled with
dark clouds and a strange, whitish dust.</p>

<p>"What is this?" called Dave to the captain, as
the latter passed.</p>

<p>"It's a tidal wave!" yelled back Captain Marshall.
"There has been another earthquake, and,
most likely, some of the volcanoes in this vicinity
have become active."</p>

<p>"Are we going down, as that sailor said?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. I will warn you, if there is any
danger of our sinking."</p>

<p>"You can't put out any small boats, can you?"
asked Phil.</p>

<p>"No, a small boat would not live a minute in
such a sea as is now running."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"Has anybody been washed overboard?" asked
Roger.</p>

<p>"I believe not&mdash;but I am not sure. It came on
so sudden, we had no time to prepare for it," said
Captain Marshall.</p>

<p>"Mr. Van Blott is below," said Dave.</p>

<p>"Van Blott! You must be dreaming!"</p>

<p>"No. He had been in hiding, and the alarm
scared him."</p>

<p>"Humph! Well, we'll take care of him later&mdash;if
we get out of this with a whole skin."</p>

<p>The boys could do nothing on deck, and so went
below again, to find that the former supercargo
had disappeared.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," observed Phil. "We know
he is on board, and he can't get away until we land,
and I guess we can root him out before that time."</p>

<p>The <i>Stormy Petrel</i> was still being carried forward,
but now the motion was a bit more steady
than before. It was true that she had encountered
a tidal wave, due to a submarine earthquake, and
also true that a volcano on the island of Cholomu
had become active. The fine volcanic dust floated
for miles over the ocean, covering the bark from
stem to stern as with flour.</p>

<p>Half an hour later came another alarm. Somebody
roared out: "Breakers ahead!" and in a
moment more the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> was in the midst
of a choppy sea, and staggered from side to side, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
if ready to go over. Then came a scraping at the
bottom.</p>

<p>"We have struck a reef!" cried the first mate.
"We are done for now!" But, even as he spoke,
the bark went on, over the reef and into what
seemed to be a large harbor. Far in the distance
could be seen a palm-fringed shore, with the waves
dashing high up on the sands.</p>

<p>It took Captain Marshall but an instant to consider
the situation, and he immediately gave orders
to cast an anchor. The <i>Stormy Petrel</i> continued to
rush onward, but quarter of a mile from the shore
the forward progress was checked. Then another
anchor was dropped, and it was seen that this had
secured a good hold. In the meantime the waters
of the tidal wave began to recede, and by sunset the
ocean was almost as calm as ever.</p>

<p>"Thank fortune, that peril is a thing of the
past!" said Dave, fervently; and the other boys
and Captain Marshall echoed his sentiments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3>EXPLORING A TROPICAL ISLAND</h3>


<p>The night to follow was an anxious one for all
on board the <i>Stormy Petrel</i>. The sea was still too
rough to think of venturing ashore, and so it was
impossible to learn to what harbor they had floated
and what was the prospect of continuing their
voyage to Sobago Island.</p>

<p>"We must be at least two hundred miles out of
our reckoning," said Captain Marshall, in reply
to a question from Phil. "This may be Tapley
Island, but I am not sure."</p>

<p>"Is Tapley Island inhabited?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure about that, either. There was
once a colony there, but I think it died out. The
natives on the other islands around here are very
fierce."</p>

<p>"Then I hope we haven't landed on one of the
other islands," remarked Dave.</p>

<p>"If we came over a reef, how are we to get out
of this harbor?" questioned Roger.</p>

<p>"That remains to be learned, Roger," answered
the master of the <i>Stormy Petrel</i>, gravely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>During the night the sea went down a great
deal, and in the morning the harbor could be plainly
distinguished. A boat was lowered, and Captain
Marshall went ashore, taking Dave and Phil with
him.</p>

<p>It was an easy matter to beach the rowboat on
the sands, and the boys leaped ashore quickly and
ran up to the nearest of the palm trees. A look
around showed all how the gigantic tidal wave had
torn and twisted everything growing near the
water's edge. In some spots the sand lay a foot
thick on beds of grass and moss and small brushwood.</p>

<p>"We can be thankful that our ship was not cast
up high and dry on the shore," remarked Captain
Marshall, as he gazed around. "That wave must
have done the shipping for hundreds of miles
around great damage."</p>

<p>The party walked up and down the beach for
almost a mile, but without seeing the first sign of
inhabitants of any sort. The shore was full of
dead fish and overturned turtles, and the sailors
took some back to the ship with them for eating
purposes.</p>

<p>It was nearly midday when they returned to the
ship, and the boys were so hungry that a mess of
fried fish was particularly appetizing to them. At
noon the captain made some observations and got
out his charts, and finally announced that they must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
be at a small island, one hundred and sixty miles
to the southward of Sobago.</p>

<p>"The island is not of great importance," said
he. "It is shaped a good deal like the letter B, and
this harbor is formed by the double curve on one
side. The interior of each of the two portions is
mostly marsh land&mdash;a good place for tropical
fevers. The reef outside of the harbor is well defined
on the chart, and extends in a semicircle for
many miles."</p>

<p>"Isn't there any opening at all?" queried Dave.</p>

<p>"For small vessels, yes."</p>

<p>"But not for a bark the size of ours?"</p>

<p>"That remains to be found out. I shall go this
afternoon and make some soundings."</p>

<p>"If there isn't any opening in the reef, what are
we to do?" asked Phil, blankly. "Why, the <i>Stormy
Petrel</i> will have to remain here forever!"</p>

<p>"Which puts me in mind of a story, as Shadow
Hamilton would say," came from Dave. "I once
heard of a fellow who built a rowboat in the garret
of his house. After the boat was done, it was so
large he couldn't get it out of the door or window,
and he had to take the boat apart again."</p>

<p>"If the boys at Oak Hall could see us now!"
cried Roger. "But about our ship. We didn't
build it here&mdash;the tidal wave sent it in, over yonder
reef. Now the question arises, how are we to get
over the reef again?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"If there is no opening in the reef, maybe we can
blow one out with dynamite," suggested Phil.</p>

<p>After dinner Captain Marshall went out in the
largest of the rowboats, taking with him his pick
of the sailors. They took a lead line along, and
remained away until dark, taking as many soundings
as they possibly could. It was dangerous
work, and those on the bark were glad when the
rowboat returned.</p>

<p>"Well, did you find a channel?" asked the first
mate.</p>

<p>"No," was the short answer. "There are several
openings, but none, that I discovered, wide
enough for the <i>Stormy Petrel</i>."</p>

<p>"Of course, you didn't cover the whole reef?"</p>

<p>"By no means. I will go out again to-morrow&mdash;or
you may do so."</p>

<p>The news the captain brought was very disheartening,
and it was a gloomy party that assembled
in the cabin of the bark that evening.</p>

<p>"We shall be perfectly safe in this harbor, so
long as the weather remains fair," said Captain
Marshall. "But a heavy blow might cause us to
drag our anchors and either run ashore or on the
reef. We must get away in the near future, if it
can possibly be accomplished."</p>

<p>"You can't get away and to Sobago any too quick
for me," replied Dave.</p>

<p>That evening Jasper Van Blott came out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
hiding and attempted to take his place at the cabin
table. But Captain Marshall would have none of
this and sent the former supercargo forward, where
the sailors made room for him in the forecastle.
This angered Van Blott intensely, and he gritted
his teeth with rage.</p>

<p>"Wait until I get the chance," he said to himself.
"I'll get square for this insult!"</p>

<p>"He can't run away for the present," the captain
explained to the boys. "When we get to a regular
stopping place, I'll put him in irons."</p>

<p>On the following morning it was so fair all the
boys begged to be allowed to go ashore and do a
little exploring. The captain was willing, but told
them to be careful. Billy Dill was to go with them,
and they took along a pistol, a shotgun, and some
provisions.</p>

<p>"If you get into trouble, fire two shots in quick
succession," said Captain Marshall. "If I want
you to return, I'll fire two shots."</p>

<p>The boys got into the boat, and Billy Dill took
one pair of oars and Dave the others. They were
soon at the beach and landed in true nautical style.
Then the rowboat was drawn up out of the water
and into the shade of some palms, that the sun
might not crack open the seams.</p>

<p>"We must be extremely careful," observed Phil.
"Remember, we do not know what is on this
island."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure, there might be lions," suggested Roger,
with a wink and a glance at Billy Dill.</p>

<p>"You boys know better nor thet," rejoined the
old tar. "None o' these South Sea islands have
much in the way o' wild beasts. But you may
strike a big snake."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, but I don't want to be introduced
to his snakeship," cried the senator's son.</p>

<p>After a little look around, they determined to
start up the shore, and did so, with their provisions
on their backs and Dave carrying the shotgun and
Phil the pistol. Roger and the old tar armed
themselves with big sticks.</p>

<p>A half-mile was covered, when they came to a
hollow, in which were basking a number of turtles,
all of great size. Phil gave a shout, and on the
instant the turtles all headed for the ocean with
clumsy, but swift, strides. Billy Dill made after
them and managed to catch the last one and turn
him over.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">Billy Dill managed to catch the last one and turn him over.&mdash;<i><a href="#Page_233">Page&nbsp;233</a>.</i></span>
</div>

<p>"He will make fine turtle soup," said the tar.</p>

<p>"So he will!" cried Dave. "I suppose I might
have shot at them."</p>

<p>"Not worth while, lad; one is enough."</p>

<p>They soon came to a portion of the shore where
the undergrowth was exceedingly close, and they
had to journey a short distance inland. The palms
were thick, and they saw numerous cocoanuts and
great varieties of beautiful ferns and gigantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
creeping vines. Billy Dill also pointed out three
varieties of bread-fruit trees.</p>

<p>"Well, a fellow wouldn't starve here, in spite of
the scarcity of meat," observed Dave.</p>

<p>"And meat isn't especially good in hot weather,"
added Roger.</p>

<p>"Natives down here eat very little meat," said
the old tar. "They use lots of yams and such stuff,
besides bananas and plantains. Everything grows
of itself, and they have a lazy man's life of it."</p>

<p>"Excepting when they fight each other," observed
Phil.</p>

<p>An hour later they came out on the shore again.
They were now away from the harbor and could
look straight out on the ocean.</p>

<p>"Look! look!" cried Roger, pointing seaward.
"Am I mistaken, or do I see a long canoe filled
with men?"</p>

<p>"It certainly is a canoe," declared Dave, after a
look.</p>

<p>"And it is filled with natives," added Phil.
"What do you make of this?" he added, turning to
Billy Dill. "Are they coming here?"</p>

<p>"I don't think they are, Phil. They seem to be
headed away from this island."</p>

<p>The canoe was certainly a large one, and they
counted at least twelve natives at the paddles, or
sweeps. Other natives were in the bow and stern
of the craft. In quarter of an hour the canoe was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
but a speck in the distance, and then it was lost to
sight altogether.</p>

<p>"We'll have to tell the captain about this," declared
Dave. "If there are natives around, he will
want to know it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they can tell us of a way out of the
harbor," suggested Roger.</p>

<p>"Like as not, if there is a way out," spoke up
Billy Dill. "They generally know the coasts putty
well&mdash;bein' out so much in their canoes."</p>

<p>The little party continued on its exploring tour,
but soon came to a portion of the marsh land the
captain had mentioned. Not wishing to get stuck,
they began to retrace their steps, until they were in
the midst of the thickets again. Then a strange
rushing sound through the trees broke upon their
ears.</p>

<p>"Wait!" whispered Billy Dill, "I know what
that is. Don't make any noise."</p>

<p>"Is there any danger?" queried Roger.</p>

<p>The old tar shook his head. Then he pointed
upward, and the boys saw a large flock of beautiful
tropical birds settling down on all sides of them.</p>

<p>"What a sight!" murmured Dave. "How
pretty they are!"</p>

<p>"They get birds for ladies' hats from places like
this," whispered Billy Dill.</p>

<p>"I know it. What a shame to shoot them down,
too!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a shame, lad; and ladies ought to stop
wearin' sech finery," said the old tar, soberly.</p>

<p>They watched the beautiful birds for some time.
Then the creatures discovered the strangers, and
off they went in a mad flight, and were lost to sight.</p>

<p>An hour later found the party passing down the
shore once more. Here they walked on the sand
until they came to something of a cove, surrounded
by stately palms.</p>

<p>"Might as well rest a bit&mdash;&mdash;" began Roger,
when Dave uttered a cry:</p>

<p>"See, the remains of a campfire!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and the remains of a feast, too!" added
Phil. "Those natives must have been here!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h3>A MAP AND A PLOT</h3>


<p>The boys and Billy Dill viewed the surroundings
with interest. Some bones lay on the ground,
and they kicked them over.</p>

<p>"These can't be human bones, can they?" whispered
the senator's son to Dave.</p>

<p>"No, Roger, they are nothing but the bones of
some small animal."</p>

<p>"I was afraid the natives might be cannibals!"</p>

<p>To one side of the camp lay a fantastically
carved stick, evidently cut by somebody during his
leisure. Dave picked this up and saw that it contained
a heart, an anchor, a cross, several links of
a chain, and some stars. At the big end of the stick
was an American flag.</p>

<p>"Hello, look here!" exclaimed the country boy.
"This is strange, to say the least. I don't believe
any native would cut a stick in this fashion."</p>

<p>"Neither do I," declared Phil. "That must have
been carved by an American, and with his jack-knife.
Perhaps some sailors were camping out
here."</p>

<p>"To me this campfire, or what's left o' it, looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
to be about a week old," said Billy Dill. "The
question is, where did the crowd go to from here?"</p>

<p>"Maybe there were some Americans with those
natives in that canoe," suggested Roger.</p>

<p>"In that case, the natives must be friendly," returned
Phil.</p>

<p>They walked around the locality and down the
shore half a mile further, but could find nothing
more of interest. Then they sat down to enjoy the
lunch they had brought, washing the meal down
at a spring, close by where the campfire had been.</p>

<p>"It is wonderful that fresh water should be so
close to the salt," observed the senator's son.
"You'd think it would all get salt."</p>

<p>"Nature knew man wanted fresh water, and so
it was placed there," replied Billy Dill. "Trust a
kind Providence to take care on us every time."</p>

<p>After the meal the party set off for the opposite
shore of the island, over a small hill which divided
one end from the other. Here the jungle was so
thick they had to literally force their way through,
and each of the boys got his clothing torn more or
less. Once the old tar became so completely fastened
that the lads had to go to his assistance and
cut him loose with their pocket-knives.</p>

<p>"I'm jest about anchored!" remarked Billy Dill.
"This is worse nor the Sargasso Sea, ain't it?"</p>

<p>By the middle of the afternoon they gained the
opposite shore of the island. Here the ground was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
very rough, but at one spot they found the remains
of a village&mdash;two houses of logs and half a dozen
thatched huts. The houses and huts were bare,
and nothing of interest was to be found around the
remains of half a dozen campfires.</p>

<p>"This shows that somebody lived here once upon
a time," observed Phil. "But it couldn't have been
much of a population."</p>

<p>"Can't tell as to thet," came from the old sailor.
"These natives live pretty thick sometimes, ten or
a dozen in one hut&mdash;and a good many live right
out under the trees."</p>

<p>Dave and Roger had passed into one of the
deserted log houses, and the country youth struck
a match, that they might see around a little better.
Somewhat to their astonishment, they saw pinned
up on a wall a sheet of water-stained brown wrapping
paper, upon which was drawn something of a
map, with a heavy cross where two lines met.</p>

<p>"Here's a discovery!" cried Dave. "Wonder
what this map was for?"</p>

<p>The others came in, and a minute later a torch
was lit, and all examined the map with care. Then
Roger uttered a cry:</p>

<p>"Dave, look there!" and the senator's son
pointed to one corner of the map. In faint letters
was the written name:</p>

<p>
<i>Dunston A. Porter.</i><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"The very man I am looking for!" ejaculated
Dave, and his heart gave a bound. "Oh, boys,
what can it mean?"</p>

<p>"It means that Mr. Porter has been here," answered
Roger.</p>

<p>"He must have been hunting for that treasure,"
said Phil. "This may be one of his maps."</p>

<p>"That's a fact," said Billy Dill. "He was always
drawing jest such things when I was with
him. He said he was bound to find that treasure
some day."</p>

<p>"This map looks to be quite old," went on Dave,
in disappointed tones. "I wish it was fresh and he
was here."</p>

<p>"He must have come here after sailing to Sobago
Island," said the senator's son, "and that can't be
so very long ago."</p>

<p>After that they made a closer hunt than before
in and around the camp, but found nothing, outside
of two buttons, a bit of lead pencil, and the broken
handle of a spade.</p>

<p>"That spade proves there was some digging
done," said Phil. "Undoubtedly he came here
looking for that treasure."</p>

<p>"Did you ever get any of the particulars of that
treasure?" asked Dave, of the old sailor.</p>

<p>"Not much, exceptin' that it was a treasure of
pearls and precious stones once hidden by some
native king. Mr. Porter didn't want to tell much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
about it, and I didn't feel as I had the right to ask
him."</p>

<p>It was now growing late, and all felt that it was
time to return to the ship. Before leaving the hut,
Dave pinned a slip of paper over the map, writing
upon it as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">To Dunston A. Porter:</span><br />
</p>

<p>"I am very anxious to meet you. I am on board
the bark <i>Stormy Petrel</i>, in the harbor of this
island, and bound for Sobago Island. Please see
me, by all means.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">David Porter.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>To this the youth added the date, and also his
home address, in case he should fail to meet Dunston
Porter and the man should wish to write to
him.</p>

<p>"That certainly ought to interest him&mdash;especially
if he is interested in a lost boy," was Roger's
comment.</p>

<p>Dave was in a sober mood when he returned to
the ship and did not feel much like talking. He
allowed the others to relate the day's experience, to
which Captain Marshall listened closely.</p>

<p>"It is certainly a pity we didn't get a chance to
talk to those natives," said the master of the <i>Stormy
Petrel</i>. "They might have shown me some way
out of this harbor."</p>

<p>"Then you haven't found any passage through
the reef?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not yet. The first mate was out with four of
the crew, but they could find nothing wide enough,"
answered Captain Marshall.</p>

<p>The master of the bark thought he spoke the
truth, but he was mistaken. Unknown to the captain,
the first mate had found a passage, rather
twisting in shape, but perfectly safe. It was near
the northern end of the reef&mdash;a locality Captain
Marshall had not visited. One of the sailors who
had been out with the mate also knew of the
passage, but Paul Shepley had pledged him to
secrecy for the time being.</p>

<p>While the boys and Billy Dill were in the cabin
of the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> relating their experiences, an
interesting conversation was going on in another
part of the ship, between the first mate and Jasper
Van Blott.</p>

<p>"I have made an important discovery," said
Shepley, in a low tone, so that no others might hear.
"I have found a safe passageway out of this harbor."</p>

<p>"Did you tell the old man?" demanded the
former supercargo, quickly.</p>

<p>"No; I told him that there wasn't any opening
wide enough for the bark."</p>

<p>"Good! Now, if we can only arrange this other
matter, Shepley, we'll make a fine thing of this,"
went on Jasper Van Blott.</p>

<p>"I don't know about this other thing, as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
call it," grumbled the first mate. "I'll be running
a tremendous risk."</p>

<p>"Oh, it will be perfectly safe."</p>

<p>"Don't you know that mutiny on the high seas
is punishable by death?"</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;if you get caught. But you won't get
caught. Besides that, please to remember that I
am not going to suffer for this cargo affair alone.
If I have to stand trial, you'll have to do the
same."</p>

<p>"Then you really mean to drag me into it, eh?"
said the first mate, sourly.</p>

<p>"Unless you consent to my plan. Why, man, it's
dead easy," continued the former supercargo,
earnestly. "I know that at least four of the sailors
will stand in with us from the start, and we can
easily win over the others by the promise of a big
reward. All we have got to do is to get Captain
Marshall, Billy Dill, and those three boys ashore,
and then sail away for some distant port. On the
way we can change the name of the bark and I'll fix
up the clearance papers, and there you are. You
and I can become equal owners, and we can go into
the regular Australian-New Zealand trade and
make a barrel of money in a few years."</p>

<p>"But supposing some of the men raise a row?"</p>

<p>"We won't give them a chance, until we are out
on the ocean. We can tell them&mdash;after the captain's
crowd is gone&mdash;that you have orders to try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
to clear the reef. When we are on the ocean, I
don't think it will be so hard to manage things.
We can arm ourselves and lock up all the other
weapons, and tell the men they shall have big
money if they ask no questions and stick to their
duty," added Jasper Van Blott.</p>

<p>"Well, how do you propose to get that crowd
ashore? They may not happen to go of their own
free will."</p>

<p>"I think I can manage that, sooner or later. The
main thing is, we must watch our chances and strike
as soon as the right moment arrives. Now then,
what do you say, Shepley?"</p>

<p>The first mate hesitated, and an argument lasting
a full hour ensued, during which the former supercargo's
plot was discussed from every possible
point of view. At last the first mate agreed to do
as Jasper Van Blott wanted, and then the two separated,
to await the time for making their first move.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<h3>MAROONED</h3>


<p>On the following morning Captain Marshall
went out once more to look for a passageway
through the reef. Dave accompanied him, and so
did Billy Dill. In the meantime Roger and Phil
rowed ashore, to see if they could find any more
traces of the natives.</p>

<p>The captain and Dave had been out about an
hour, when they noticed a small boat coming
toward them, containing two sailors and the first
mate.</p>

<p>"Captain Marshall, you are wanted on shore
at once!" cried Paul Shepley, when within hearing
distance. "Those two boys just sent word to the
ship by a native. They said to bring young Porter
and Dill along."</p>

<p>"They must have discovered something!" cried
Dave, quickly. "Oh, let us go, by all means!"</p>

<p>"I will," answered the master of the <i>Stormy
Petrel</i>. "Did they say where they were?"</p>

<p>"Near the interior of the island, I believe," answered
the mate.</p>

<p>No more was said, and, winding up his lead line,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the captain had the rowboat turned around and
headed for the island. In the meantime the first
mate returned to the bark. Once on the deck of
the ship he was quickly joined by the former supercargo.</p>

<p>"What did he say?" asked Jasper Van Blott,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Said he'd go."</p>

<p>"Then we must lose no time in getting up the
anchors. Luckily the breeze is just right."</p>

<p>"Wait until they are ashore and have disappeared,"
answered the first mate, nervously. He
was really a coward at heart, and now fairly under
the thumb of Van Blott.</p>

<p>It took but a few minutes for the captain, Dave,
and Billy Dill to gain the stretch of sand. Then
those on the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> saw them draw the
small craft up to a safe place and disappear in
among the trees.</p>

<p>"Now then, act as quickly as you can," said
Jasper Van Blott.</p>

<p>An order was issued for the sailors to come on
deck, and all did so, and the second mate, a young
man named Bob Sanders, also appeared. Then
Paul Shepley issued orders to hoist the anchors and
raise some of the sails.</p>

<p>"What does this mean, Mr. Shepley?" asked the
second mate, in surprise.</p>

<p>"The captain has found a passageway and wants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
me to take the ship out and around to the other
side of the island," replied the first mate. "He
wants us to be lively, too."</p>

<p>Bob Sanders was mystified, but, as he was not on
particularly good terms with the first mate, he
asked no more questions. Soon the sails were up,
and Paul Shepley himself steered the bark toward
the passageway he had discovered.</p>

<p>"You are sure of what you are doing?" asked
Jasper Van Blott, coming to the wheel. "We
don't want to strike and go to the bottom."</p>

<p>"I wish I was as sure of the future as I am of
the passageway," answered the first mate, somewhat
grimly.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't worry about the future," answered
the former supercargo, lightly. "In a few days
we'll have everything in apple-pie order."</p>

<p>There was a good breeze, and the bark cleared
the reef with but little difficulty. Then Paul Shepley
had all the sails set, and soon the <i>Stormy Petrel</i>
was leaving the island far behind.</p>

<p>In the meantime Captain Marshall, Dave, and
the old tar were looking everywhere for Phil and
Roger. They dove straight into the jungle and
called out as loudly as they could. But no answer
came back.</p>

<p>"It is queer that we can't locate them," was
Dave's comment. "If they wanted us, I should
think they would be watching out, wouldn't you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps they are in trouble," answered the captain,
gravely.</p>

<p>He fired his pistol as a signal, and at last came
an answering shot from the lower end of the island.
At once they hurried in that direction, only to find
themselves cut off by a stretch of impassable marsh
land.</p>

<p>"Reckon as how we'll have to go around," observed
Billy Dill. "If we try to go through thet
we'll git stuck, fer sartin!"</p>

<p>Going around was not so easy, and it took them
nearly half an hour to cover a mile. Then the captain
discharged his pistol once more, and a minute
later came an answering shot but a short distance
away.</p>

<p>"I see them&mdash;at the top of the hill!" cried Dave,
and, looking ahead, the others discovered Phil and
Roger at the top of the slight rise of ground, waving
their handkerchiefs to attract attention. Soon
the two parties were together.</p>

<p>"What's the news?" cried Captain Marshall,
looking around to see if anybody else was present.</p>

<p>"No news," answered Phil. He gazed at them
curiously. "What's up? You look rather excited!"</p>

<p>"Didn't you send for us?" gasped Dave.</p>

<p>"Send for you? What do you mean?" queried
Roger.</p>

<p>"The first mate said you sent a native to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
bark, asking us to come to you," said Captain
Marshall.</p>

<p>"We sent nobody&mdash;we have seen no natives to-day."</p>

<p>There was a pause, during which each looked
blankly at the others.</p>

<p>"I can't understand this," said Dave, slowly.
"Mr. Shepley certainly delivered that message."</p>

<p>"It is a trick of some sort!" burst out Captain
Marshall. "The very best thing we can do is to
get back to the vessel without delay."</p>

<p>The others thought so, too, and in a moment
more all were on their way to the shore, hurrying
through the undergrowth as rapidly as the bushes
and vines would permit. Phil and Roger had
managed to shoot two small animals that looked
like hares, but that was all.</p>

<p>At last they came out on the sands, and a shout
of dismay went up.</p>

<p>"The ship is gone!"</p>

<p>"The <i>Stormy Petrel</i> has sailed away and left
us!"</p>

<p>The boys and the old sailor turned to Captain
Marshall, whose face had turned white. Now it
grew dark and stern.</p>

<p>"How could they get out of the harbor?" questioned
Dave.</p>

<p>"Shepley must have found a passageway," answered
the captain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>"But where has the ship gone to?" queried Phil.
"I can't see her anywhere."</p>

<p>Instead of replying, the captain of the <i>Stormy
Petrel</i> clenched his hands and compressed his lips.
He was doing some deep thinking.</p>

<p>"I must say, this looks to me as if somebody had
run off with the ship!" declared the senator's
son.</p>

<p>"And that is just what they have done!" cried
the captain. "Oh, the rascals! the scoundrels! If
I ever catch them&mdash;&mdash;" He could not finish, so
great was his rage.</p>

<p>"Run off with the ship!" burst out Dave. "How
could they do that? Do you think there was a
regular mutiny?"</p>

<p>"There may have been&mdash;anyway, the bark is
gone&mdash;and we are left to shift for ourselves."</p>

<p>"I think I see through it," said Phil. "The first
mate and Van Blott have hatched this up between
them. I know they were as thick as peas&mdash;in fact,
I suspect Shepley helped the supercargo to hide
away on board. They must have bought over the
crew and Mr. Sanders."</p>

<p>"I don't think they could buy over Bob Sanders,"
declared the captain. "I know him too well. He is
very quiet, but I'd trust him with almost anything.
But I can't say as much for all the crew. Shepley
got some of the men to ship, and he most likely
knew whom he was getting."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you going to do about it?" asked
Roger.</p>

<p>"I don't exactly know what to do, yet, lad. We
are marooned, that is all there is to it. And it
doesn't look as if they had left us anything to live
on, either," added the captain, casting his eyes
along the shore.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say they have deserted us?"
cried Dave.</p>

<p>"Doesn't it look like it?"</p>

<p>"And stolen the bark?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Dave drew a long breath. Here was another
set-back, of which he had not dreamed. If the
<i>Stormy Petrel</i> had really sailed away, not to return,
what were they to do, and when would they get a
chance to leave the lonely island?</p>

<p>"This is positively the worst yet!" groaned
Roger. "The fellows who would do such a thing
ought to be&mdash;be hanged! And they haven't left us
a thing!"</p>

<p>"Let us separate and see if we can sight the
bark," said the captain, and this was done, one
party going to the upper end of the island and the
other to the lower. But not a trace of the missing
vessel was to be seen.</p>

<p>It was a decidedly sober party that gathered on
the sands two hours later to discuss the situation
and decide upon what was to be done. Here they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
were, marooned on a deserted island, with no food
and but little shelter, and with only two pistols and
a shotgun between them. It was certainly not a
situation to be envied.</p>

<p>"I used to think, when I was a small boy, that
I'd like to play Robinson Crusoe," remarked
Roger. "But I've changed my mind, and I'd much
rather be back on the ship."</p>

<p>"Humph! If you are going to talk that way,
what will you say if we have to stay here weeks, or
months, or maybe years?" asked Phil.</p>

<p>"Gracious!" burst out Dave. "You don't think
we'll have to stay here years, do you?"</p>

<p>"We'll have to stay until we can git away," was
the sage remark of Billy Dill. "Captain, are we
in the track o' any ships?"</p>

<p>Captain Marshall shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>"I don't think we are. That storm blew us far
out of our course. I doubt if a ship comes this way
once in three months."</p>

<p>"There, what did I tell you!" cried Phil. "But
don't think I want to stay," he added, quickly. "I
am just as anxious to get away as any one, and
anxious to regain my father's ship, too. Why,
to lose her would mean a serious loss to my
father!"</p>

<p>They talked the matter over until nightfall, but
without reaching any satisfactory conclusion. Not
one of the party could bring himself to think that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
he would really have to stay on the island for any
great length of time.</p>

<p>"If we do have to stay, we'll have to rassle around
fer somethin' to eat," remarked Billy Dill. "The
mean sharks! They might at least have left us a
barrel o' salt horse an' some canned goods&mdash;an' a
little tobacco," he added, dolefully. His pipe was
empty and so was his pouch, and this added the last
drop to his misery.</p>

<p>As night came on they gathered some driftwood
and lit a campfire, not because they were cold, but
because it looked more cheerful, and because it
also helped to keep away some obnoxious insects
that had appeared. Over the fire they cooked the
game Roger and Phil had shot, and made a supper
of this and some crackers the boys had been carrying
in their pockets. Then they sat down to talk
the matter over once more. As the night advanced,
the bright stars bespangled the heavens and all
became perfectly calm and quiet. Tired out by
what had passed, one after another sought a comfortable
resting-place, and soon all were sound
asleep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h3>THE COMING OF THE NATIVES</h3>


<p>When Dave awoke, it was with a start. The
wind was blowing half a gale and the rain was
falling.</p>

<p>"What a change since last night," he murmured
to himself, as he sat up. "Hello, are you up already?"</p>

<p>"I am," answered Billy Dill. "Thought as how
I'd better keep the fire a-goin', if it's goin' to storm.
This ain't so nice, is it?"</p>

<p>"I should say not, indeed. My, now the wind is
rising!"</p>

<p>The others soon roused up, and all gathered
under the shelter of some dense tropical trees and
vines. Soon the rain was pouring down in torrents,
shutting out the landscape on all sides.</p>

<p>"Well, in one way, it's a good thing the <i>Stormy
Petrel</i> got out of the harbor," remarked Captain
Marshall. "This wind might make her shift, and
either throw her up on the island or on to the reef."</p>

<p>They could do nothing with the fire, and so
allowed it to die out, and crawled still further into
the jungle in an endeavor to keep dry. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
rain followed them, until each one of the party was
about soaked.</p>

<p>"This is another one of the comforts of a Robinson
Crusoe life," remarked Phil. "Soaking wet,
and nothing to eat. Oh, don't I wish I was on the
bark again and had hold of those mutineers!"</p>

<p>The rain and wind kept up for the best part of
that day. There was but little thunder and lightning,
and at nightfall the storm died away, although
the wind still kept up at a lively rate. During
the afternoon they managed to find a turtle in
a hollow, and, after turning the creature over,
killed it and cooked it in its own shell. The meal
was not particularly appetizing, but all were exceedingly
hungry and partook of it without a
murmur.</p>

<p>"To-morrow we must gather some yams and
some plantains, and also do some fishing," said the
captain. "We might go hunting, too, but I would
rather save our ammunition for emergencies."</p>

<p>To keep from taking cold in their wet clothing,
all slept close to the campfire that night, and early
in the morning they hung most of their garments
out in the bright sunshine to dry. Fishing proved
good, and the boys and Billy Dill caught over a
score of good-sized fish, and also discovered a bed
of oysters, which, as Roger declared, "were not
half bad, even if they weren't particularly good."
In the meantime the captain, who knew not a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
about tropical life, tramped around and found
some bread-fruit and some luscious berries, which
he declared were perfectly good to eat.</p>

<p>"This solves the question of food, at least for the
present," said Dave. "Not a very extensive list of
things to eat, but much better than nothing at all."</p>

<p>"What would the boys of Oak Hall say if they
could see us?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"We'll certainly have a tale to tell&mdash;if we ever
get back to tell it," returned Phil.</p>

<p>Having nothing in particular to do, they took
their time about preparing the next meal, and, when
it was done, it proved to be a regular spread. Some
of the fish made particularly good eating, and the
berries topped the repast off in good style.</p>

<p>"I do not believe that the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> will
come back to this harbor," said Captain Marshall.
"And that being so, I think we had best take ourselves
to the other side of the island, to those log
huts and shacks you mentioned. That is, most
likely, the spot where the natives land and where
ships may stop. We can put up a flag of distress,
and, after that, there will be nothing to do but to
wait and make the best of it."</p>

<p>"Shall you leave the rowboats here?" asked
Dave.</p>

<p>"We can leave one boat here and row around
the island in the other. We can carry the craft to
some point beyond the reef."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>This advice was followed, and beyond the reef
line the ocean was found to be comparatively quiet,
despite the storm of the day before. All entered
the rowboat, and the captain and Billy Dill took
the oars, and the voyage to the other side of the
island was begun.</p>

<p>By the end of the day they had reached the log
houses, and they cleaned out the larger of the two
and gave to it as much of a homelike appearance
as possible. Then they set to work to gather all
the driftwood possible, for they had nothing with
which to cut firewood. The boys fell to fishing
once more, and Phil began to manufacture a snare,
with which he hoped to trap some small animals
that had been discovered at a distance.</p>

<p>Another whole day passed by slowly, and they
began to feel a little more settled, when, in the
middle of the afternoon, Billy Dill, who was out
in the rowboat trying to catch some big fish, set up
a loud shout.</p>

<p>"What is it?" demanded Captain Marshall, who
was busily at work breaking up some of the driftwood.</p>

<p>"I see a big canoe comin', loaded with niggers!"
announced the old sailor.</p>

<p>This news brought all to the shore immediately,
and they watched the approach of the canoe with
much interest. It was all of twenty-five feet in
length and manned by twelve dark-colored men, six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
on each side. The natives in the craft numbered,
all told, nineteen, and some of them had guns,
while others had bows and arrows and long spears.
Each man had also a long and sharp knife stuck in
his girdle.</p>

<p>"Do you think they will be friendly?" asked
Dave, in a low tone.</p>

<p>"I hope so," answered the captain. "They have
nothing to gain by being otherwise."</p>

<p>When the natives discovered the whites, they
stopped rowing and set up an animated jabbering
among themselves. They looked around, thinking
a ship must be close by, and, finding none, were
much astonished.</p>

<p>"Hello!" called out Captain Marshall, waving
a welcome. "Glad to see you!"</p>

<p>To this the natives did not answer. But the
canoe was sent closer and finally beached, and the
majority of the black men leaped ashore, each
carrying his weapons with him.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" went on the captain, extending
his hand and smiling. "Glad to see you. Can
anybody speak English?"</p>

<p>At the question, one of the natives, a short, thickset
fellow with a peculiarly flat nose, came to the
front and shook hands.</p>

<p>"Soko speak Inglees," he said, and grinned.
"Soko once on Inglees ship."</p>

<p>"I am glad to know you, Soko," replied the cap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>tain.
"I am Captain Marshall, of the ship <i>Stormy
Petrel</i>. What island is this?"</p>

<p>"Dis Yam-kolo Island," answered Soko, still
grinning. "How you come dis way? Where he
ship?"</p>

<p>"Some rascals have stolen my ship. She is a
fine-looking bark. She was here a few days ago.
Have you seen her?"</p>

<p>"No see ship, no&mdash;no ship, so many days," and
the native held up four fingers, all stumpy and not
overly clean. "Steal ship on you? Big thief,
yes!"</p>

<p>"You are right. Where do you come from?"</p>

<p>"Come from Waponu. Dat on Sobago Island."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have heard of the place." The captain
turned to the others. "It is a native village some
ten miles from the town for which the <i>Stormy
Petrel</i> was bound," he explained.</p>

<p>"Then perhaps they can take us to Sobago," said
Dave, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they can," answered the captain. "But
it must be a long trip in such a canoe as that."</p>

<p>"Tell me," said Dave, to the native. "Do you
come here often?"</p>

<p>"Sometime, not many time," answered Soko,
still grinning. He was evidently of a sunny disposition.</p>

<p>"Did you ever come here with a man named
Dunston Porter?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>At this question the native shrugged his shoulders
and looked perplexed.</p>

<p>"I mean this man," went on the youth, and, taking
the native by the hand, led him into the hut
and up to the map on the wall. Instantly the face
of Soko brightened.</p>

<p>"Yes, Soko know," he said. "Dat man come, so
many time here&mdash;&mdash;" He held up three fingers.
"Look in ground, dig, not can find much, no. Go
back to Sobago, so." And he made a dejected face,
at which Roger and Phil had to laugh.</p>

<p>"He means Mr. Porter didn't locate the treasure,"
said the senator's son.</p>

<p>"Is that man in Sobago now?" went on Dave,
paying no attention to his chum's remark.</p>

<p>"Yes, him at big town, Nanpi!"</p>

<p>"Good I Then I would like to get to Nanpi just
as soon as I can," cried Dave, enthusiastically.
"Will you take me there? I can pay you well," he
added, for he still had his money belt and cash with
him.</p>

<p>"Yes, can take to Nanpi," answered the native.</p>

<p>After that he explained that he and his companions
had come to the island to hunt for some
rare birds and for turtles. They were quite willing
to return to Sobago Island immediately, if paid
for so doing. A bargain was struck, and it was
decided that the voyage should be begun in the
morning. In the meantime all hands were to catch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
some fish and cook them, and also gather in a
supply of other eatables. The natives had a number
of hollow reeds with them, and these were filled
with fresh water, just previous to setting out. It
was calculated that, weather permitting, the distance
would be covered in three days.</p>

<p>"These fellows know how to handle their big
canoes very well," explained Captain Marshall.
"They go out hundreds of miles, and sometimes
weather the worst of storms. Occasionally, of
course, they get swept away, but not often. They
sail altogether by the sun and stars, and can strike
almost as straight a course as if they were using a
compass."</p>

<p>Dave questioned Soko further about Dunston
Porter, but could learn little, outside of the fact
that the man was a treasure hunter and had paid
very well for what was done for him. Soko added,
however, that he thought the man expected to
remain at Sobago for some time.</p>

<p>The boys could sleep but little that night, so
anxious were they concerning the trip before them.
They were up at dawn, but, early as it was, found
the natives ahead of them. A hasty breakfast was
had by all, the things to be taken along were packed
in the bow and stern of the canoe, and shortly
after sunrise the craft was pushed from the shore,
whites and natives scrambled in, and the start from
the lonely island was made.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<h3>THE RETAKING OF THE "STORMY PETREL"</h3>


<p>For the whole of that day the natives kept at the
sweeps of the long canoe, one set of rowers relieving
the other. The whites were willing to assist,
but Soko said the natives could get along best alone,
they having their own peculiar manner of handling
the craft.</p>

<p>The weather remained fair, with only a bit of
a breeze blowing, and the bosom of the ocean was
as calm as they could wish. They were soon out of
sight of the island, and then all they could behold
was the sky above and the sparkling waters on
every side.</p>

<p>"It must be terrible to be lost on the ocean,"
remarked Phil, as he gazed around. "I don't
wonder that men go mad, after they have been
out days and days."</p>

<p>"And think of having nothing to eat or to
drink," said Dave. "Ugh! it gives a fellow the
shivers to think of it!"</p>

<p>At noon the whole party partook of a lunch,
and toward nightfall had supper. Then the whites
went to sleep, and so did half of the natives, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
remaining blacks keeping at the sweeps, guiding
themselves by the stars, now that the sun had gone
down.</p>

<p>When the boys awoke they were dismayed to see
that a mist covered the sea.</p>

<p>"Hello! I didn't expect this!" cried the senator's
son. "Why, a fellow can't see a hundred feet in
any direction."</p>

<p>"What are the natives going to do now?" asked
Dave of Captain Marshall, who had been awake
for some time.</p>

<p>"Soko says they must rest and wait," answered
the captain. "He cannot go ahead, for he knows
not in what direction to steer."</p>

<p>"I've got a pocket compass!" cried Phil, bringing
it forth. "How odd that I didn't think of it
before."</p>

<p>The captain took the compass and showed it to
the native who could speak English. He had seen
such things before, and, after a short talk with the
master of the <i>Stormy Petrel</i>, set the others to using
the sweeps as before.</p>

<p>It was about ten o'clock of the forenoon that one
of the natives, who was watching in the bow,
uttered a short cry. At once those at the sweeps
stopped pulling.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Captain Marshall, quickly.</p>

<p>"Big ship over dare!" announced Soko, a
moment later.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>All of the whites looked in the direction pointed
out, and through the mist saw a large vessel drifting
along, the sails flapping idly against the masts.
The wheel was lashed fast, and nobody was in
sight on the deck.</p>

<p>"The <i>Stormy Petrel</i>!" ejaculated Captain Marshall.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" asked Dave and Phil, in a
breath.</p>

<p>"Sure it's the bark," cried Billy Dill. "Say, but
this is great luck, ain't it?" and his face brightened
up. "Now we can teach them dirty mutineers a
lesson."</p>

<p>"Dat you ship?" asked Soko.</p>

<p>"It is," answered Captain Marshall. "See here,
Soko," he went on, "can I depend upon your helping
me? I will pay you and your men for whatever
you do."</p>

<p>The native shugged his ebony shoulders and then
consulted with his fellow-tribesmen. All decided
that they would aid the captain, providing he would
give them each a piece of silver "so big," pointing
out the size of a trade dollar. Captain Marshall
agreed on the spot, and preparations were made
for boarding the bark.</p>

<p>"It is queer that nobody is in sight!" remarked
Phil, as the canoe drew closer.</p>

<p>"Somebody is coming on deck now!" cried Dave,
in a low tone, and Paul Shepley appeared, followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
by Jasper Van Blott and, close behind him, one of
the sailors.</p>

<p>"Hello! what's this?" sang out the first mate, on
catching sight of the canoe.</p>

<p>"Captain Marshall and the others!" muttered
the former supercargo. "Hi! keep away from
here!" he roared.</p>

<p>"Surrender, you villains!" called out the captain.
"What do you mean by running off with my
ship in this fashion?"</p>

<p>"You keep off!" warned Paul Shepley, without
answering the question. "Keep off, I tell you!"</p>

<p>"We'll fire on you, if you don't keep off," called
the former supercargo, and he brought forth a big
pistol.</p>

<p>"Be careful, cap'n, or somebody will git shot!"
whispered Billy Dill. "Those fellers look like they
was des'prit!"</p>

<p>"Don't you dare to shoot!" called out Captain
Marshall. "The first man who fires shall swing
from the yardarm!"</p>

<p>The loud talking had brought several sailors to
the deck, and they were followed by the second
mate, who stared at the canoe and its occupants as
if he could not believe his eyes.</p>

<p>"Hello, Captain Marshall!" sang out Bob Sanders.
"I am mighty glad you have come."</p>

<p>"Then you are not in this mutiny, Sanders?"</p>

<p>"Not by a jugful! They tried to buy me up, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
I wouldn't consent. Podders, Diski, and McNabb
are not in it, either."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it. Sanders, take control of
the ship until I get aboard."</p>

<p>"He will do nothing of the kind!" yelled Jasper
Van Blott, and was about to turn on the second
mate, when the latter hit him a blow in the ear,
sending him headlong to the deck.</p>

<p>"McNabb! Podders!" called the second mate.
"Grab Mr. Shepley!"</p>

<p>The sailors called upon understood, and before
the first mate could turn, one tar had him from
behind, so that he could not raise his arms. Then
the other seized a pistol and, turning, faced the
crew with the weapon.</p>

<p>The turn of affairs had been so sudden that
Shepley and Van Blott were taken completely by
surprise, as were likewise the sailors who had sided
with the rascals, and, for the moment, none of them
knew exactly what to do. In the meantime the
canoe bumped alongside of the <i>Stormy Petrel</i>, and,
catching hold of a trailing rope thrown overboard
by the sailor named Diski, Captain Marshall
hauled himself to the deck, followed by Billy Dill
and the boys.</p>

<p>"Do you surrender?" demanded the captain,
striding up to the first mate, revolver in hand.</p>

<p>"Ye-yes!" burst out Shepley. "It's&mdash;it's all a
mistake, Captain Marshall&mdash;all a mistake!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>"I reckon it was!" answered the captain, grimly.
"What about you, Van Blott?" And he turned on
the former supercargo, who was struggling to his
feet.</p>

<p>"I suppose I've got to give in," muttered Jasper
Van Blott.</p>

<p>"And what about you men?" demanded Captain
Marshall, turning his stern eyes on the portion of
the crew that had mutinied.</p>

<p>"We're with you, cap'n," said one, humbly.
"Mr. Shepley led us into this, without us knowin'
what we was a-doin'. Ain't that so, mates?"</p>

<p>"That's so," said the others, humbly.</p>

<p>"Are you willing to obey me, after this?"</p>

<p>"Yes! yes!" came in an eager chorus.</p>

<p>After this a long talk took place, and Jasper
Van Blott and Paul Shepley were placed in irons
and conducted to a closet in the bow of the ship,
used for the storage of oil and lanterns. The place
was given a rough cleaning, and then the pair were
locked inside, Captain Marshall putting the key in
his pocket. Both of the prisoners wanted to protest,
but the master of the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> would not
listen.</p>

<p>"You can do your talking later, when I have time
to listen," said he. "Just now I have other matters
to attend to."</p>

<p>From Bob Sanders and the three loyal sailors
Captain Marshall got a fairly accurate account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
the mutiny. He was told that Jasper Van Blott
had done his best to get all hands to join in the
plot. The former supercargo was the prime mover
in the affair, and the first mate was a coward and
had been little more than his tool. The sailors
who had gone in had done so rather unwillingly,
and, after thinking the matter over, Captain Marshall
decided to read them a stern lecture and then
forgive them.</p>

<p>It was now no longer necessary for the natives to
take the whites to Sobago Island, and, after a brief
consultation, Soko and his men were paid off and
given some presents, and then, the mists rising,
the canoe was headed back for Yam-kolo Island.
It was the last that Dave and his friends saw of
these black men, who had proven so friendly.</p>

<p>With the first mate in irons, Bob Sanders was
advanced to fill his place. This left the position of
second mate vacant, and, after a consultation with
the boys, the master of the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> offered
Billy Dill the position, and he accepted gladly.</p>

<p>"I always kind o' wanted to be a mate," said
the old tar. "I'm tickled to death!" And his face
showed it.</p>

<p>With the lifting of the mist a stiff breeze came
up, and preparations were made for continuing the
voyage to Nanpi. It was found that the last
storm had slightly disabled the rudder, which accounted
for the fact that the bark had not made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
greater headway on her trip. But additional
parts were on board, and by nightfall the damage
was made good, and then the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> answered
her helm as well as ever.</p>

<p>"And now for Sobago Island!" cried Dave, to
his chums. "I hope I have no more trouble in finding
Mr. Dunston Porter!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<h3>LIFTING THE CURTAIN</h3>


<p>The second mate told the truth when he said
Paul Shepley was a coward and under the thumb
of the former supercargo. That very evening
Shepley begged to see Captain Marshall alone, and,
when given the opportunity, actually fell on his
knees before the master of the <i>Stormy Petrel</i>.</p>

<p>"I am willing to do anything, captain!" he
groaned. "Only don't&mdash;don't swing me from the&mdash;the
yardarm!" He had it firmly fixed in his
mind that he was to be executed.</p>

<p>"You deserve to be hanged!" answered the captain.
"I don't see why I should spare you."</p>

<p>"It was all Van Blott's fault&mdash;he fixed the whole
thing from beginning to end. He got the stolen
cases on board and made me promise to help in
getting rid of them. And he got up the plan to
run away with the ship."</p>

<p>After that Paul Shepley told his story in detail,
and the captain became convinced that the first
mate was more of a sneak than a villain.</p>

<p>"I will let you off, upon two conditions," said
Captain Marshall, at last. "The first is, that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
serve as a common sailor for the rest of this trip.
Will you do it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but it's pretty hard on me," whined Shepley.</p>

<p>"The second condition is, that you promise to
appear against Van Blott, whenever called upon to
do so."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll do that."</p>

<p>"Then go forward and take Billy Dill's place in
the <a name="castle" id="castle"></a><ins title="Original has forcastle">forecastle</ins>."</p>

<p>"Where is Dill to go?"</p>

<p>"I have made him second mate and Sanders first
mate."</p>

<p>"Oh!" murmured Paul Shepley, and said no
more. It cut him deeply to take up quarters in the
forecastle, where the men treated him any way
but kindly, yet he was glad to get off so cheaply.</p>

<p>The next day was an anxious one for Dave, who
was on the constant lookout for land. Toward
nightfall a speck was seen in the distance, and in
the morning, when he came on deck, the country
youth saw before him Sobago in all of its tropical
beauty, with its cozy harbor, its long stretch of
white sand, and its waving palms. In the harbor
were ships of several nationalities, and also numerous
native canoes, and the scene was an animated
one.</p>

<p>The boys had no difficulty in getting ashore, but
once on the streets of Nanpi, they scarcely knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
how to turn. They walked along slowly until they
came to a shipping office, in the window of which
was a sign:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="1" cellpadding="25" cellspacing="0" summary="sign">
<tr><td align="left"><i>English Spoken Here.</i></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>"I am going in here to ask a few questions,"
said Dave, and entered, followed by Phil and
Roger. They found in the office a very stout and
very bald old gentleman, wearing big spectacles.</p>

<p>"You speak English, I believe," said Dave,
politely.</p>

<p>"I speak English, and a dozen other languages,
too," said the bald-headed gentleman, peering at
them curiously. "Why&mdash;er&mdash;how's this?" he
added, to Dave. "Is this some joke? Why did
you shave so clean?"</p>

<p>"Shave?" repeated Dave. His heart gave a
sudden bound. "Why do you ask that question?"</p>

<p>"Why, I&mdash;er&mdash;this is most extraordinary!"
ejaculated the man, still staring at the country
youth. "I don't understand it."</p>

<p>"Don't understand what?"</p>

<p>"You look so much like a man I know&mdash;a Mr.
Dunston Porter. Maybe he is some relative of
yours?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>"The very man I am looking for!" cried Dave.
"Can you tell me where I can find him?" His
heart was almost in his throat as he asked the
question. Supposing Mr. Dunston Porter had left
Sobago Island for parts unknown?</p>

<p>"Find him? I think so. He was here yesterday
and said he was going out to the ruins of the
old temple on the Pokali Road. He expected to be
gone all day on the trip. He'll be back to town
by night."</p>

<p>"Then you'll have to wait, Dave," came from
Phil.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't wait!" burst out Dave. "How far
is that old temple from here?"</p>

<p>"About three miles."</p>

<p>"Can I hire somebody to take me there? I
want to see Mr. Porter as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"Certainly; you can get a boy for a few pennies,"
answered the bald-headed man. "There is a boy
now who wants a job." And he beckoned to an
urchin who sat on an empty box, eating a banana.</p>

<p>When the lad came up the man explained in the
native tongue, and soon the party set off, Dave first
thanking the bald-headed man for his kindness.</p>

<p>To Phil and Roger the walk on the tropical road
was long, hot, and dusty. But Dave was so busy
with his thoughts that he did not notice he was
walking at all. How much the next hour or two
might reveal!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently they came in sight of a ruined pile,
which the native boy pointed out as the old temple.
Dave forged ahead and hurried into the ruins, and
then around to the back. Here, from under some
palms, could be had a fine view of the surrounding
country.</p>

<p>A hasty glance around revealed to Dave the
form of a man, lying on the grass half asleep. The
country youth hurried forward, gave a good look,
and uttered a little cry, at which the man sat up
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked the man, and then he
began to stare at Dave very hard.</p>

<p>"Is this Mr. Dunston Porter?" asked Dave, in
a voice he tried in vain to steady.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's my name. But you&mdash;&mdash;" The man
paused expectantly.</p>

<p>"I am Dave Porter. I have come about seven
thousand miles to see you."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 406px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;I have come about seven thousand miles to see you.&quot;&mdash;<i><a href="#Page_274">Page&nbsp;274</a>.</i></span>
</div>

<p>"Dave Porter! Seven thousand miles to see me!
I must be dreaming!" The man leaped to his feet
and came up to Dave. "How is this? Won't you
explain?"</p>

<p>"I will try, Mr. Porter."</p>

<p>"They do look exactly alike!" said Phil to
Roger, in a whisper. "What an extraordinary
likeness!"</p>

<p>"No wonder Billy Dill was startled when he first
met Dave," added the senator's son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Dunston Porter heard the talk and looked at
the others. At this Phil took a step forward.</p>

<p>"We are Dave Porter's school chums," he explained.
"My name is Phil Lawrence, and this is
Roger Morr."</p>

<p>"Glad to know you. Did you travel seven thousand
miles to see me, too?" went on the man.</p>

<p>"Hardly that, but we took the trip with Dave,"
answered Roger.</p>

<p>"He wanted to find the man who looked like
him," continued Phil, for he saw Dave could
hardly speak for his emotion. "And he has found
him. You two look exactly alike&mdash;that is, you
would, if your mustache was shaved off."</p>

<p>"Yes?" Dunston Porter paused. "Is that all?"</p>

<p>"No! no!" cried Dave, struggling to keep calm.
"I came to&mdash;to find out something about myself, if
I could. It's a long story, and I'll have to start at
the beginning. When I was a youngster about
three years old, I was picked up alongside a railroad
track by some farming people. They supposed
I had been put off a train by somebody who
wanted to get rid of me. They asked me my
name, and I said something that sounded to them
like Davy and Dun-Dun and Porter, and so they
called me Dave Porter."</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Dunston Porter, and he was all
attention. "Go on."</p>

<p>"I was taken to the poorhouse, and then went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
live with some other folks who were very kind to
me, and one rich gentleman sent me to a boarding
school. While there I helped an old sailor named
Billy Dill&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Billy Dill! Well, I never! Go on, please."</p>

<p>"He was struck when he saw me&mdash;said I was
somebody else with my mustache shaved off, and a
lot more. He finally told me about you, and said
you had told him about a crazy nurse and a lost
child, and so I made up my mind to find you, if I
could, and see if you knew anything about my
past." Dave's lips began to quiver again. "Can
you tell me anything?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;perhaps so." Dunston Porter's voice
was also quivering. "Can you prove this story
about being found near a railroad?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"About thirteen years ago?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"In the eastern part of the United States?"</p>

<p>"Yes, near a village called Crumville. They say
I said something about a bad man who wouldn't
buy some candy for me. It may be that that man
put me off the train."</p>

<p>"He did!" almost shouted Dunston Porter. "It
was Sandy Margot, the worthless husband of the
crazy nurse, Polly Margot, you just mentioned.
She took the child and turned the boy over to her
husband. Margot wanted to make money out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the abduction, but, during his travels with the little
one, he learned that detectives were after him, and,
when the train stopped one day, he put the child
off and promised it some candy to keep it from
crying. He got away, and we never heard of him
for about six years. Then he was rounded up in a
burglary and badly wounded. He confessed at
the hospital, but he could not tell the name of the
place where the child had been dropped. We made
a search, but could discover nothing. Margot died,
and so did his crazy wife; and there the whole
matter has been resting."</p>

<p>"But who am I?" cried Dave, unable to restrain
the question any longer.</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't know that? I thought Billy Dill
knew. If what you have told me is true, you are
the son of my twin brother, David Breslow
Porter."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<h3>HOMEWARD BOUND&mdash;CONCLUSION</h3>


<p>"I am the son of your twin brother?" repeated
Dave, while Roger and Phil listened with intense
interest.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Dunston Porter. "He lost his
son exactly as described, and the baby was said to
resemble me very strongly."</p>

<p>"And where is your brother now?"</p>

<p>"He is traveling for his health. The last I heard
of him he was in Europe, at one of the well-known
watering places."</p>

<p>"Is his wife alive?"</p>

<p>"No, she died years ago. But he has a daughter
with him, Laura&mdash;about a year younger than you."
Dunston Porter took Dave's hand. "This is simply
marvelous! I can hardly believe it! My nephew
Dave! Why, it sounds like a fairy tale."</p>

<p>"It is marvelous, Mr. Por&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold on! If we are relatives, you'll have to
call me Uncle Dunston," and the man smiled
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Well, then, Uncle Dunston, are my father and
my sister alone in the world?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>"They are, excepting for me. We used to have
other brothers, and a sister, but all of them are
dead. I am alone here&mdash;an old bachelor."</p>

<p>"But you used to live with my father, is that
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we were once in business together&mdash;owned
a chemical works in New York and another in
Chicago, and we also had some patents for manufacturing
gas by a new process. But both of us
liked to travel around, and so we sold out, and
since that time we have been roaming around the
world, sometimes together, and then again alone,
although he always takes Laura with him, no matter
where he goes. He is afraid to leave her
behind, for fear she will be lost to him just as you
were."</p>

<p>"Do you know his exact address now?"</p>

<p>"No; but I think a letter sent to a certain address
in Paris will be forwarded to him. To tell
the truth, I have been out here so long I have partly
lost track of him. He will be amazed to hear
from you, I am sure, and Laura will be surprised,
too."</p>

<p>"I shall write to him as soon as possible," answered
Dave.</p>

<p>"Of course! of course! And I will write too,"
rejoined Dunston Porter.</p>

<p>After that, sitting in the shade of the old temple
and the palm trees, Dave and his chums told their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
story from beginning to end, and then Dunston
Porter related some of his own experiences and told
much more concerning Dave's father and sister
Laura. He said that he and his twin brother
looked somewhat alike, which accounted for Dave's
resemblance to himself. He was glad to add that
both he and his brother were well-to-do, so they
could come and go as they pleased.</p>

<p>"As you know, I am hunting for a treasure of
pearls and precious stones," said Dunston Porter.
"So far, I have been unsuccessful, but I feel sure
that I shall find them some day. And, even if I
don't, the task of looking for the treasure pleases
me and gives me the chance to visit many of these
beautiful islands of the South Seas."</p>

<p>The boy who had brought Dave and his chums
to the old temple had been dismissed, and Dunston
Porter took them back to Nanpi, where he had
accommodations in the best public house the place
afforded. Here Billy Dill visited him.</p>

<p>"Does my heart good to see ye again!" cried the
old tar. "An' ain't it jest wonderful about Dave?
Now stand up, side by side, an' look into thet glass.
As like as two beans, say I!" And Dunston Porter
agreed with him.</p>

<p>Of course the old sailor had to tell all he knew,
and Dave brought out pictures of Caspar Potts and
the Wadsworths which he had brought along. In
return, Dunston Porter gave Dave pictures of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
father and his sister Laura. The boy gazed at the
photographs a long while, and the tears filled his
eyes as he did so.</p>

<p>"Well, there is one thing sure!" he murmured to
Roger. "At any rate, I am no longer a poorhouse
nobody!"</p>

<p>"That's right, Dave," returned the senator's
son, warmly. "Let me congratulate you. By that
picture, your father must be a nice man, and your
sister is handsome."</p>

<p>"And to think that they are rich," added Phil.
"That's the best of all."</p>

<p>"No, the best of all is to find that I belong somewhere
in this world&mdash;that I am not a nobody,"
answered Dave, earnestly.</p>

<p>"Won't Nat Poole and Gus Plum stare when
they hear of this!" went on Roger. "I believe it
will really make them feel sore."</p>

<p>"Ben and Sam and the others will be glad," said
Phil. "And I am sure Doctor Clay will want
to congratulate you. Dave, it paid to take this trip
to the South Seas, after all, didn't it?"</p>

<p>"I should say it did!" cried Dave. "I shouldn't
have wanted to miss it for the world!"</p>

<p>For several days Dave felt as if he was dreaming
and walking on air, his heart was so light. The
more the boy saw of his uncle Dunston the more
he liked the man, and Dunston Porter was equally
pleased. Both had long talks regarding the past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
and the future, and it was agreed that the man
should return to the United States for the time
being and, instead of hunting for the treasure, trace
up the present address of David Porter, senior, and
Dave's sister Laura.</p>

<p>"I wish to meet this Caspar Potts, and also the
Wadsworths," said Dunston Porter. "If I can, I
wish to repay them for all they have done for
you."</p>

<p>"I am sure they will not take any money,"
answered the boy. "But they will be glad to meet
you." Later on Dave took his uncle on board
the <i>Stormy Petrel</i>, where Captain Marshall gave
the newly found relative a very enthusiastic welcome.</p>

<p>The captain of the bark had thought to bring
Jasper Van Blott before the authorities at Nanpi,
but was prevented by an accident, which came close
to terminating fatally and sending the bark up into
smoke and flames. Jasper Van Blott attempted to
break out of the oil closet in the bow of the <i>Stormy
Petrel</i>, and, in so doing, lit a match. This fell on
some oily waste in a corner and, before an alarm
could be given, the former supercargo was seriously
burned, and the whole bow of the bark was on fire.
Jasper Van Blott had to be taken to a hospital,
where it was said he would lose the sight of one eye
and be disfigured for life. Under such circumstances,
it was decided to let the case against him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
drop. The damage to the <i>Stormy Petrel</i> was so
serious that the bark had to be laid up for repairs,
and, in such an out-of-the-way place, it was said
these would take a month or six weeks.</p>

<p>"This has certainly proved to be a strange voyage,"
said Roger. "I must say, I don't like the
idea of staying here six weeks. I'd like to get back
home."</p>

<p>"Just what I say," answered Dave.</p>

<p>In the port was what is known as a "tramp"
steamer, that is, one picking up any cargo to be
found, from one port to the next. This steamer
had secured a cargo for San Francisco, and was to
sail on the following Saturday.</p>

<p>"We might secure passage on her," suggested
Dunston Porter, and inside of twenty-four hours it
was arranged that he, with Dave and Roger, should
sail on the steamer. Phil was to remain with Captain
Marshall, to straighten out the mess left by
Jasper Van Blott.</p>

<p>"But never mind," said the shipowner's son,
when the chums came to separate, "I'll see you
again, sooner or later&mdash;and then we'll talk over all
the many adventures we have had."</p>

<p>Dave and Roger found the accommodations on
the steamer fully as good as those on the bark, and
the voyage to San Francisco passed pleasantly
enough. As soon as the boys went ashore, they
hurried to the post-office, where they found half a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
dozen letters awaiting them. One, from Ben Basswood
to Dave, interested them greatly:</p>

<blockquote><p>"You will be glad to learn that Shadow Hamilton
is cleared of the trouble that was laid at his
door," so ran the communication. "Doctor Clay
had somebody set a watch, and, as a consequence,
it has been proved beyond a doubt that Gus Plum
took the stamps from where Shadow placed them
in his sleep. When Plum was accused, he said he
didn't know they were the doctor's stamps. It
seems he needed money, as his father is down in the
world and has cut off Gus' spending allowance.
There was a big row, but the Plum family is hushing
the matter up, and I understand Doctor Clay
has agreed to give Gus one more chance at Oak
Hall."</p></blockquote>

<p>"It is just like Doctor Clay to give him another
chance," was Roger's comment. "He is as kind-hearted
as any man in the world."</p>

<p>"If I ever go back to school, I hope I have no
more trouble with Gus Plum," said Dave. But he
did have trouble, of a most peculiar kind, and what
it was will be told in another volume of this series,
to be entitled: "Dave Porter's Return to School;
Or, Winning the Medal of Honor." In this new
volume we shall meet all our old friends once more,
and learn something further of Dave's father and
sister Laura.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>Dave did not depend on the mails, but, as soon
as he could, had telegrams flashed to Crumville and
to Doctor Clay, stating he had found an uncle
and soon expected to meet his father and sister.
Then the party of three took a Pullman train for
the East.</p>

<p>"I can tell you it feels good to get back to the
United States once more," said the senator's son,
as the boys sat by the car window, looking at the
scenery as it glided by.</p>

<p>"Do you know, it seems an age to me since we
went away," declared Dave. "And yet, it is only
a little over two months!"</p>

<p>"That is because so much has happened in the
meantime, Dave. It was certainly a remarkable
trip!"</p>

<p>"And the trip brought remarkable results," said
Dunston Porter, with a quiet smile.</p>

<p>When Dave arrived at Crumville there was
quite a gathering to receive him and the others.
All the Wadsworths were there, including Jessie,
who rushed straight into his arms, and Caspar
Potts and Ben Basswood.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad you are back!" cried
Jessie.</p>

<p>"We are all glad," added Ben.</p>

<p>"We cannot bear to think of losing you, Dave,"
said Mrs. Wadsworth, anxiously. "You have become
very dear to us all."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are not going to lose me; that is, not altogether,"
answered the boy. "No matter what
happens, I shall never forget all my old friends!"</p>

<p>And all shook hands warmly. And here, kind
reader, let us take our departure.</p>
